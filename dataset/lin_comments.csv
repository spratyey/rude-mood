As to why firmware doesn't make it back upstream: because they're binary blobs. Lineage and other projects based of of [AOSP](https://source.android.com/) have to do a *lot* of work to extract these, since most hardware suppliers don't make them available, and you won't find the source anywhere.

Why can Linux run on most desktops but not most phones?,"It's more accurate to say you can run the same kernel+initramfs binary on most desktops, but each phone requires a different binary.

The biggest obstacle is phones lacking a unified boot / hardware detection mechanism. On desktops, booting is just MBR or UEFI, ACPI + PCIE can find most of the hardware.

On a phone you need to hard-code what is soldered to each pin of the SoC into the kernel, or at least into the initramfs. Linux can't even read its own boot media without that information, and there is no standardized accessible-on-boot data source like the ACPI table.

Baseband firmware isn't the problem here: the kernel cares more about how the baseband is connected than what runs inside it. You can plug a M.2 LTE modem on a desktop and the kernel would detect it over PCIE, then upload a binary firmware and start using it. No such luxury on a phone.",39,linux,BibianaAudris,

Mostly because phones don't have hardware discovery mechanisms and require that kernel has all information like memory ranges used for IO on this exact phone. On desktops there's ACPI which is basically a directory of non-auto-discoverable devices, and PCI which provides device discovery mechanism (via host-to-PCI bridge which is discovered via ACPI). On phones in theory there's DeviceTree instance passed from bootloader to kernel, but in practice it only contains few devices which the bootloader has to initialize in order to boot the kernel, and the rest has to be compiled into the kernel itself. And infinite minor differences between different phones and devices inside them make it almost impossible to create a unified kernel which would gather enough interested developers for a self-sustained process.

Why can Linux run on most desktops but not most phones?,"There are a couple of problems with phones:

* They run on arm which, unlike your desktop PC, has no standard hardware auto-discovery protocol, meaning that if you want to run an OS on it you need to get a description of where the hardware is in memory, as this layout itself is not very standard, and usually kept by the SOC/phone manufacturers, it's not as trivial as just running make. Booting ARM is also not as simple as booting X86.
* The hardware running on ARM is more diverse and does not rely as heavily on established protocols. This means that driver support may be missing in the kernel for parts of the hardware. Also, the diversity means that a lot of firmware files which may not be publicly available are also needed to get it running.

Agreed, which is why I never said that, nor did the OP ask why you can't run Ubuntu Touch on any phone.

And if you look at [this comment by the OP](/r/linux/comments/q2cpc2/comment/hfmc2qn/) the intent of the question was: why doesn't Linux support more phones out of the box, which I answered as well.

I also never claimed the question is invalid in any way, but this isn't [ELI5](/r/ELI5), so rather than explaining in simple terms I present facts. And the facts are:
- Linux (the Kernel) is on the majority of phones. Based on [these numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Market_share) Android, and thus the Linux kernel, has a market share of ~88%.
- Linux (the distributions) go beyond just Ubuntu, and depending on your personal definition *can* include Android (AOSP) or ChromeOS, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution#Examples). Otherwise you'd have to say that OpenWRT isn't Linux as well, as it doesn't ""behave"" like a Desktop Distro as well.
- Using a bit of effort and free (as in freedom) software you can make *almost any* Android phone look and behave just like a Desktop

Let us introduce you to the secure open-source alternative to Teams!,"I gave it a whirl, so here's some constructive feedback.

Your self hosting process sucks right now. 

You've got a dockerized install which is nice and should lead to fast and easy deployment, but the configuration story just doesn't work. Your start script uses `sleep` to let the initialization process finish before continuing, which means it will either not wait long enough to get it done or wait too long for no reason, with no feedback at all. Docker can run these tasks in the foreground instead of just crossing your fingers and sleeping for 10 minutes. You can't expect someone launching this on a big fast machine to not wonder wtf is happening when it goes silent for 10 minutes, you're gonna get a control c and abort at some unknown place.

Your setup guide has notes on various things you can configure, but it's laid out in such a way that you're going to look for them after finding out you missed something. Your setup guide should be a storyboard on how to go from nothing to a working install, and if something is optional you can mark it as optional... If something is an esoteric option most people aren't expected to need, mark it as such.  You should only have to open the config file once to set all the parameters, not start it, check logs for errors, look for docs related to that error, find and charge a setting, then start again.

The node container expects the database container to already be available, which means it will crash and die ad leave you wondering what's happening when you get part of a page load and then a http 502. Manually restarting that container seems to be the only option.

Once I finally did have a ""working"" install, I created an account (oh all those mail features needed to be configured, go do that real quick and come back), got logged in, ok this is neat let's try the android app. Easy enough to install, open it, hit the button to change server, put in my server URL, hit the login button, and crash.

Let us introduce you to the secure open-source alternative to Teams!,"Hi u/D_r_e_a_D

We know there is a lot of attention to the Matrix protocol. When we built Twake, Matrix was not mature enough and popular enough to be widely used. Also Twake was initially more an application hub than a messaging app.

Today we are focused on the messaging part of Twake as we have dedicated teams for others features (drive, tasks, video, office, and integrations). It means we have big things to achieve like compatibility with Matrix, implementation of end-to-end encryption and more. This is a work we started almost one year ago and we continue today, you can expect to see first releases with matrix and e2e encryption next year.

Also to answer a follow-up question about why we will not rebuild Twake from scratch on top of Matrix and why we prefer to build a matrix adapter instead is our current features. We support reddit-like threads and answers, ability to move answers from a thread to an other, we have a lot of applications integration, complex message building blocks for those, and to quote some of the reddit answers below we have a specific notification system based on mentions, ability to unread channels, ability to post messages to multiple channels, user thread view, bookmarked and pinned messages, private/public/access-by-link channels etc.

Let us introduce you to the secure open-source alternative to Teams!,"Hi,

Thanks for this extensive feedback, as mentioned in another message here we are in the process of migration from php to node and from ScyllaDB only to ScyllaDB or mongodb compatible.

The current installation procedure is complex because you have both php and node configuration files, but also this need to run php before node and after making sure ScyllaDB is running.

You probably also noticed that our onpremise images are locked to the Q3.505 version which is a version from 6 month ago. Why? Because we removed support for our old login system to replace it by what we call the “Console”. But as it is still in development we decided to put back a login workflow to the app.

In conclusion, the on-premise images are stuck to a version that is not compatible with mobile and are using a complex stack with redis and ScyllaDB (for all the features and scalability you would have also needed redis and elastic search and minio).

But good news ! It’s been a year we worked on this issues ! In the next release (22 of October) 80% of Twake will be available with the simplified mongodb+node stack and will be compatible with mobile !

1. We believe in the open-source software and it is one of our core values. The pricing page highlights locked features in the paid plans for SaaS versions. However, our open-source version includes all the features (including premium and enterprise) and available on Github for anyone to download and use it. 
2. We have not checked Taiga yet. We do have a marketplace of applications not mature yet but it already supports 15+ applications such as Github, Gitlab, OnlyOffice, Zapier, Integromat, n8n, and of course incoming webhooks and outgoing webhooks. For instance we plugged our server alerts system to our Twake technical channel to be notified instantaneously!
3. We also provide an open API to build your own integrations. Maybe that can be used for Taiga as well?

Glade.  Although it doesn't have proper support for GTK4 yet, but that's brand new.

I *would* blame developers for it.  They should architect their codebase the way it's always been done with a modular platform non-specific core and build thin UIs layers for whatever platforms they're targeting.  That eases porting to mobile devices and still keeps open the option of compilation to wasm if they *really really* want to have a webapp.  If they want to support a platform that they aren't particularly familiar with they can do this model and leave it to a community member who *does* have intimate familiarity to do that instead of just writing it in JS and getting a shitty experience on *every* platform.

I fully understand the performance benefits of running native binaries. You're preaching to the choir. Not everyone does, however, and that's my point. People who don't touch anything other than javascript probably aren't using programs like vim, emacs, or even something relatively bloated like JetBrains to write their software. They're using something like VSCode or Atom (blech) and LOVE them. They're GOOD programs to get work done and they're conditioned to think that that's just how polished, full-featured software runs.

As a result, these people, with their low expectations for how a quad+ core CPU runs their desktop software (have you used Teams lately?), have accidentally set the bar equally low for the applications they are building.

RAM. Is. Cheap. Here's a nice table illustrating just how cheap it has gotten: [https://jcmit.net/memoryprice.htm](https://jcmit.net/memoryprice.htm)

RAM is abused because it's cheap. People should be able to run modern software but can't because the developers abuse memory. Because they choose 'bloated frontend web stacks' in favor of native code.

In a nutshell: the old Freenode staff (volunteers) didn't perceive Andrew Lee's takeover of Freenode as legitimate but didn't have the resources to fight it in court, so they packed their bags and left to create a new network that they called Libera. Many FOSS projects who had been working with the old staff for years trusted the old staff more than the new administration, so they decided to follow them to the new network.

If Andrew Lee had laid low at this point and just kept things running smoothly, I'd bet many channels would've remained on Freenode and trust could've been established between the remaining community and the new management.

Instead, Andrew Lee reacted to this exodus very poorly and started enacting mass seizures of channels that even mentioned Libera in their topics. Many of the channels that were seized were still in the process of weighing their options. Needless to say, these seizures immediately alienated a huge bunch of people, including channels that might've stayed otherwise. At some point Andrew Lee also decided to ban a paid IRC client (IRCCloud), because ""fuck irccloud"" (his own words), seemingly with no care for IRCCloud users. These kind of loose-cannon actions didn't inspire much confidence in the ability of the new management to run a stable network, so at this point Freenode was practically bleeding users.

Then Andrew Lee started making plans to migrate to a new network altogether but without any plan to migrate user data, so everyone would have to start from scratch. No advance notice was given, the new network simply appeared one morning and users who were trying to connect to the old Freenode were suddenly on the new network without any clue what was happening. Andrew Lee said that the old version of Freenode would still be around to smoothen the transition. Then Andrew Lee suddenly reneged on his word, and simply nuked the old Freenode and 20 years of history with it. Again, no advance notice was given. It looked like a spur-of-the-moment decision, a far cry from the stability of pre-Andrew Lee Freenode.

> Kernel 5.11

The changes you mention don't increase compatibility, they are completely performance oriented. So it doesn't make more programs run, it makes programs that already run more performant.

> Proton

While a safe assumption when you're talking about Reddit, the vast majority of computer users aren't gamers, and as neat as proton is it's easy to over-epmphasize its benefits.

> Darling

We'll see how this turns out in practice. Now that Apple has begun moving to ARM, the job gets a lot harder... Then of course there's the fact that most apps available for Mac are also available on Windows, and more likely better supported via Wine. If it weren't for the ARM move I'd be a lot more enthusiastic about this as in theory Mac apps are much closer to Linux apps.

> Gaming

Again, the majority of computers aren't used for gaming, even if 99% of Redditors are gamers. This focus is great for the people who are but if we're talking about it in the context of increasing the userbase you're really limiting yourself to people who probably use linux somewhere else already anyway.

ChromeOS is a great example of giving users a Linux system that is easy to use and flexible. With Crostini (native linux apps) it's a great gateway to a ""real"" linux system, but for many users that jump isn't even necessary.

Linux, in its current state, will never make it to the mainstream desktop. While having choices is amazing and its one of the main reasons why I'm on Linux right now, there are too many choices!

See, there are many ""mainstream"" desktop environments, each with its own philosophy, there are apps based on each of them, sometimes they work across different DEs, sometimes its a total mess. There are at least 6 major ways to package and distribute software (APT, RPM, Flatpak, Snap, AppImage are the ones I hear the most - and I include AUR here because everything is in there, according to people that use it), plus ones that are lesser known.

It almost feels that people gather in groups, fork something and do whatever tf they want with it, sometimes adding another layer of complexity on something that has everything to be dead simple.

You know, just because you can fork something and make it your own out of it doesn't mean you should do it - but people are far more concerned about discussing about freedom (free vs libre), how evil proprietary code is, why we need another Ubuntu fork with only libre software that'll leave your computer half-working because the features people actually want and need are on the proprietary, evilish code you cannot audit, so it must be the devil itself written in binary notation.

Not to mention how inconsistent stuff are on Linux. I've lost how many times I found something that looked completely broken without any custom themes, or how many times I saw one application half-written in english and half-written on my language, or how many times one very nice looking screen invokes something right from the pits of uglyness from hell (addendum: not that Windows is any better on this particular aspect, as it suffers from the very same problems - the difference is that with Linux people could actually get together to fix those things, but instead they make a fork with the fix you can only get by installing their fork or waiting until it goes upstream on your distro...)

It still works great with a couple of tweaks but it could be WAY better than it is.

I'm speaking in the sense of a PC user which I know are dwindling even in the Windows market. The only thing stable about Linux is the Linux kernel itself. It's the nightmarish GUI apps that are making it so clunky but as I mentioned, I like clunky. I can work with it and make it not so clunky. 

My biggest fear (and probably everyone else in the Linux community) is that Linus Torvalds isn't going to be building Linux kernels forever. Who ever takes it over needs to have the same drive (if not more of a drive) than Linus had in the early stages of the kernel. He's still got the drive and putting out good kernels but eventually he's going to want to pull back from it. Everyone wants to slow down and smell the roses. And he's deserved it. Hopefully he will find someone to take the reins and keep the kernel alive without large corporate influences. The last thing we need is for Linux to turn into another Apple or Microsoft.

I don't think Valve or System76 are contenders. Valve can't even get a gaming console off the ground and System76 is a just a hobbyist computer shop. They just do not have the resources to take in the desktop market at a large scale. I think the most likely candidates are Google or Microsoft.

Microsoft is a strange candidate but I think it's possible. OS and kernel development is resource intensive.

You can't customize any rgb in your Pc on linux, you can't change Logitech mouse shortcuts on linux, you get the idea, we need vendors to care about linux to create utilities for linux so you can use all the features

Heh. A big reason I use the hardware I do is that everything can be configured on the hardware itself, and so doesn't need those utilities that are only available on Windows. I dislike those utilities anyway, since they don't integrate with the rest of the OS. IMO, hardware features should be able to be configured within, for example, the KDE system settings, without needing a custom utility. 

As for the rest… on my end I've avoided using these incompatible softwares in the first place because even before I switched to Linux I was moving to free software on my old MacBook, which wasn't compatible with many of these anti-cheat games in the first place either so I never had a chance to get into them.

Interesting take that I don't really see discussed on r/linux but think about very often.

I'd argue popularizing piracy on desktop Linux would hurt Linux more than benefit it though. We barely have companies that make profit on Linux selling their software as products, it's already a tiny userbase to sell your product, if people start pirating their software and decrease their sales even if just for a year that would be a strong demotivator.

The risk doesn't come from using Linux; it comes from conversion of your process and systems. The same would be true if you were using Linux and wanted to switch to Windows.

Neither did I say the Linux community was ""a"" problem.

Yes, decentralization, freedom, ease of sharing, ease of modification/forking have enormous benefits.

However these values can also hold it back when it comes to **mainstream desktop** adoption. The only distro that managed to break into mainstream on an end-user device (besides routers and appliances) was Android/Linux and there's a reason for that -- its much easier for vendors and developers to support it, yet it achieves this by lessening or prohibiting the values both of us have mentioned.

The problem I was noting was the community itself has extensive elitist and toxic traits that can both hinder collaboration after internal disagreements and work against new users, and that partially explains why new users are like a revolving door, most of which return to Windows, as the stats typically indicate.

With Linux the community support is often more important than with other OSes, end-users must deal with it -- yet it is by far the most toxic and elitist. That is a huge problem.

That's not an easy problem to solve. Just look at how Linus talks to his own contributors, some of which have now ceased contributing after his attitude. This occurs throughout the entire community, often with both users and developers being treated like shit, and it cannot be fixed with a patch or fork.

>You say that it doesn't solve the problems, but just look at how far it has come in the last decade. So many problems have been solved for desktop uses. So much ""just works"" now. Saying it never will ignores the huge progress that has already been made.

Care to elaborate? If you say, customisation, shorter boot times, etc, they are barely a problem.

>And also Windows has actually moved backwards in this respect. Things were actually somewhat more stable and user friendly (with a few exceptions obviously) on Windows a decade ago.

Lol no. Windows is much refined compared to previous versions. Much better command line shell, finally an app store, much more secure etc.  

>If Linux keeps moving at the pace it has, and especially if Microsoft keeps slowly moving backwards, it seems to me it's only inevitable that Linux eventually solves all those problems.

Linux on desktop is not moving forward, if it is moving anyway. Neither Microsoft needs to worry about linux taking over desktop marketshare. MS no longer focuses on Windows, they would have been if linux was a threat.

>I think the real obstacle standing in the way of Linux on the desktop is software. Microsoft needs to get Office 365 to a state similar to local Office, Adobe needs to support Linux, etc.

Well, place yourself on developers perspective. First there is no standard way to develop for linux. GTK, QT, this, that? A dev would be confused what to use. Secondly, dev would have to compile for every distro out there, considering how time consuming and rather waste of time and resources, considering combined market share of all distros is may be lesser than 3 percent. Zero to barely, backwards compatibility. Which means, every time there is a change in OS, like in kernel, ABI, APIs or core libraries, dev would have to make changes to app's codebase so that it would work with new changes. There is no challenge to Windows, when it comes to backwards compatibility. I recently installed 3D Pinball on my Win10 machine, a 20 year program that came with WinXP, and it runs just fine.

Because almost 10 years ago I remember trying OSS4 and had an impression that it sounded better than ALSA. And with ALSA I earlier had an impression that it sounded better than PulseAudio, but now can't tell the difference. 

FreeBSD's `newpcm` has a bitperfect mode, by the way, which is convenient for comparing pure and mixed sound, and generally I have the least doubts with FreeBSD's sound. NetBSD is good too (though it's different), OpenBSD is good too (though there is no mixing, mixing is done by `sndio` in userspace).

Possibly too hard to do over multitude of display systems, not enough market share to make it worth it...who knows.

TL;DR: Blame Nvidia, not Windows. (And believe me, I wish it was on Windows. I do not like Windows.)

I'm genuinely curious to see support of your other claims (Darktable etc), in the form of objective tests. My own cursory google turned up nothing. (I didn't even know there was a win build of darktable.)

By your ridiculous definition of energy usage, nothing on a grid uses energy because all energy is being produced.

Take a second to consider that, that that clearly isn't how the world works.

The reality is that when power is produced and made available as voltage, this is then drawn down by devices that need them, electronics do not have a fixed current going through them (if it did all fans would be fixed speed as the heat output due to resistance is proportional to current^1). 

What actually happens is that the power put into the grid is monitored, so that the voltage remains consistent, there are a bunch of variables to account for to prevent [phase shifting/drifting](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-strange-reason-clocks-across-europe-are-running-6-minutes-slow-digital-oscillations-time), but ultimately the power put into the grid has to equal the power taken out and a lot of work goes into making sure that is the case.

I'm talking about something else, that there is an excess of energy being produced all over the world that has nowhere to go. Why is the excess there? You'd have to ask the local government. In China for example there is a lot of hydroelectric. If bitcoin didn't exist to consume that excess energy, would that excess energy not be produced? It still would.

When most people describe a doomsday scenario with bitcoin boiling the oceans because all the fossil fuels get burnt to produce electricity for mining, they happily discount that it's trivial for authorities to shut those things down. Ask illegal weed growers if they have a hard time hiding from the police, they totally do. A power company is like that but way hotter, it's impossible to hide it. So if it really ends up being a problem (I don't think it will) then local authorities will be able to act on it.

By the way if you want to make a fair comparison why don't you look at how much energy your dollars or euros consume? That includes the legacy servers, all of the government needed, the entire US military to protect it. 

Also its not like miners have unlimited money (governments do which is why they are so wasteful), so they have an incentive to find the cheapest source of energy and use as little of it as possible. What happens when solar becomes cheaper than gas?

And finally, all of our lives consume. If you don't want to consume then ceasing to exist is the only way to do that. Nobody gets to decide for someone else how much they are allowed to consume, it is up to each individual to decide that for themselves.

Most web development is targeted at server side platforms that aren't Windows - Apache, Node.js etc.  I get the impression that many folks doing this development outside the corporate IT space are using Linux or MacOS as their desktop and that MS views this as a threat to their ""Developers Developers Developers"" mindshare.

WSL2 comes across to me as an effort to make Windows a viable development platform for server-side web applications targeted at Linux based server infrastructure - mainly on cloud platforms such as Azure.  I don't think they see any serious chance of knocking Linux off the servers, and nor do they want to as Linux-on-Azure is making them loads of money in the cloud services space.

Windows is still king of the hill in corporate I.T. - at least outside of the Fortune 1000 - and that's not likely to change anytime soon.  However, outside of Office I think they see hosting services as a bigger long-term cash cow than the SME market of yesteryear.

If desktop Linux becomes established as the go-to platform amongst cloud development folks then that does make for a core market based on desktop linux that would drive demand for other applications to run on it.  Given its prevalence as a target for new-build applications, then it could be big enough to establish a foothold.  PCs are sorta-kinda a legacy system when it comes to application development; most new builds are taking place for mobile platforms or cloud deployments.  If those get ceded to Linux or MacOS then Windows becomes a minority platform for software development; that would not be good news for Microsoft.

So, from that perspective, I think they are doing WSL2 largely to keep developers who are building for cloud platforms using Windows as their main development environment - and to keep Windows-focused work experience in that space as well (and Visual Studio, for that matter).  WSL2 lets these folks deploy locally onto their machine for development and testing purposes without letting RedHat or Canonical get a foot in the door to sell infrastructure or development tooling.  It also provides a more gentle bridge for folks used to working with Windows to work in that space as they can just keep using a familiar development environment.",2,linux,nobby-w,

1. Terminal based - I mostly program in vim, so being able to just split my terminal window and using a calculator there is much better than having a separate app for it.
2. I was working with 8 bit, and 16 bit operations WAY more than I was with 64 bit operations. The app I was using didn't allow me to do 8bit math - it's harder to see overflows, when the ZERO FLAG is set, etc. So I made a program that allowed me to change the number of bits used whenever I wanted. (You write \`8cb\` or \`16cb\` to change the number of bits used and displayed)
3. Multiple representations: I wanted to write decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and even binary numbers - but I could only insert hex and dec and I'd have to change the calculator mode. So I made a program the allowed me to write \`0x13 + 135 - 0b101\` without any resistance :)

Blob free video decoding in linux,TLDW? What exactly is a stateless video decoder and how does it relate to the commonly known VAAPI?,23,linux,banqueiro_anarquista,
Blob free video decoding in linux,"Simplifying a bit, a compressed video stream is basically a continuous sequence of data (the compressed frame) and metadata (what parameters have been used to compress that frame). That sequence is called a bitstream. 

Now, any generally useful codec these days will use temporal compression, which means that in addition to the compression typically being used for an image compression algorithm, they will also be able to have compression between frames. For example, if the image was completely still, you'd just store the information that it's basically the previous frame. You will also have things like motion vectors, so let's say if you have a tracking shot from left to right (so with parts appearing on the right, and disappearing on the left), you would encode that the central part of the frame has moved left, and just add the new content on the right. 

This is all used to provide a compression as efficient as possible, but that means that you also have to have a list of the references images that have been used to compress the current image.  So you need to keep the former images (and parameters) over, and this is what the ""state"" is.

There's two main classes of hardware video decoders, the stateful and stateless decoders. The stateful decoders are able to process the entire bitstream themselves, so you pretty much only have to put the bitstream somewhere in memory, point the decoder to it, and it will start to output decoded frames. It will keep the state somewhere in the hardware and you won't have to worry about it, hence why it's stateful.

The stateless ones however need to be provided the data and metadata separately, since they aren't able to process the bitstream directly. In Linux, that means that the user-space needs to pre-process the bitstream, and then feed the data and metadata to the kernel. And the state has to be provided every time, hence why they are called stateless.

Stateful hardware codecs are mostly on the way out and are dropped in favor of stateless codecs since the stateless are so much simpler to design in hardware.

VA-API is a userspace API that abstracts away how a particular hardware codec needs to be programmed from its user (usually media players). In essence, it's similar to what OpenGL is for the 3D acceleration.",59,linux,mac_s,
Blob free video decoding in linux,"This guy decodes. 

Thanks for a great explanation. Is it safe to assume that stateless hardware requires a little more cpu cycles and memory to pre process the streams? And that in recent times cpu cycles and memory are abundant enough to ditch stateful hardware (in pc systems)?",10,linux,gsmo,
Blob free video decoding in linux,"There's indeed a CPU and memory overhead, but it's not really as bad as one would assume. Indeed, there's several factors here that need to be considered:

* The CPU overhead is there, but it's not that bad. I don't have a benchmark handy, but on a RaspberryPi3-like system, last I checked the ballpark figure was around 10% of one CPU used to decode a 1080p video.
* The CPU overhead is constant compared to the resolution
* The Memory overhead is only really about moving the metadata around, so and is also not increasing with the resolution
* Since the stateless codecs design is simpler, it's easier to make it more power efficient (and it is more power efficient by design too), so what is a loss on the CPU consumption can actually be a win on the system-wide power consumption.",18,linux,mac_s,

2 years ago I decided to experiment with Linux and installed arch (probably because of memes and because I wanted to experiment and not actually use it). A few months later, I hardly ever booted into windows, so well yeah. I am happy with it.

Am I a better or more intelligent person because of this? definitely not. Most people that actually actually code a lot use other distros.

In my experience, the arch subreddit is pretty nice, people are giving long answers to ""dumb"" questions, explaining a little background and stuff like that. About the arch forums I honestly don't know but I've heard a lot of negative things about their ""kindness""(deleting everything stuff that had already been answered / is in the wiki), but on the other hand they feel pretty ""sorted"" when reading (I've only read threads I found by googling and not asked something myself)

Then there is the I use arch btw circlejerk. I don't know how many of those just use arch, feel actually superior because of it or just want to troll/live the meme etc etc. And I totally understand that it annoys people (including me) if this is spammed all the time.

What kind of triggers me, is that on the meme side of subreddits (linuxmemes), I see a lot more memes depicting arch users as people craving for saying ""I use arch btw"" than actual post saying this. This honestly makes me feel bad and a little angry...

But i also think that it can sometimes be frustrating trying to help people that just provide very vague answers (doesn't boot, don't have internet what now?) there's a million things that can be the reason and we can't help without a little more information, again that doesn't justify any toxicity but i can see how sometimes it can be tiring to help those new users.  

And it's not like the new users mean any wrong, they just aren't experienced enough to provide more info on what they are doing when following the wiki or when watching a youtube video(that is probably outdated and no longer works but that's for another day) which goes back to the original point , if someone is completly new to Linux why are they installing Arch in the first place?  

It's not that Arch is difficult but it requires a little bit of familiarity, i'm all for people doing whatever they want in Linux but i just think that starting with something like Arch doesn't make sense for me and it can be very frustrating trying to setup everything up when it's a whole new world that you are yet to discover, at the end of the day we want to install Linux to use our computers, we don't want to use our computers to install Arch.",14,linux,hearthreddit,

Yes, we do have our RTFM users, and it can be a toxic atmosphere.

One in particular I remember about a problem with Steam and it involved a number of back-and-forths, and in the end I got it sorted.  You can see the post [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=251924).  As you can see if you read it, I did my best to provide as much information in my post as possible.  I did this by doing a simple search on the forum for people with trouble with Steam, and seeing what the responders asked for.  I then ran those commands and posted the output in my original post.  In the end, the solution was in a part of the wiki I should have already tried if I'm honest.

The person who solved my problem was patient and helpful.  I guess this is because my post wasn't '*Steam is crashing...help!*'.  I took a little initiative and did my best to not waste their time.  Contrast this with the endless, incessant amounts of people who post on this sub with 'I've installed Arch and it's stuck on Grub' or 'My Nvidia thing won't work, here's a screenshot, what do I do?'.  Maybe if they did a simple search they could check the plethora of people with the same issue and maybe sort it out themselves.

I don't deny there's some elitism in Arch.  But it's not a beginner disto and you're expected to put in some effort yourself.  If you want your hand held all the way, stick to Ubuntu.  There's nothing wrong with Ubuntu, it's where I started.  And it's suitable for beginners.  Arch isn't.  If you post for help in an Arch community, if you don't put 'here's what I've tried so far to fix my problem...' then you're probably going to get snarky replies.

As a Linux user for a few years, I stopped asking questions a long time ago and just lurk or do searches for what I need; reddit has enough negativity, Id rather spend extra time searching on my own for a solution, and also keep most thoughts to myself, rather than be met with posts rudely suggesting that you are an idiot for not knowing everything, and constant arguments.

What all of this stems from I couldn't tell you. People being overly obsessed with Linux and taking things personally perhaps? I see especially members loathing fresh newcomers, who are the exact people we should be WELCOMING if we ever want Linux to grow.

My experience with Arch: I tried to install it in a VM  using the wiki instructions once and ran into a problem. Google didn't have the answer but led me to some forums. I didn't find my issue there but many of the topics were answered with ""read the wiki"". I didn't bother to post my issue there. I found an IRC channel and posted my issue there and ""read the wiki"" was the response from several people. Fair enough. I went back and read the wiki several times and did not find my issue there. I started the install over, making sure to be very careful about following the instructions and ran into the same issue. I gave up and installed Gentoo instead, which was much easier.

Why is the mindset around Arch so negative?,"I don't think it is specific to Arch, but I have a guess. Linux is a very open community, but selectively so. Historically, anyone who even attempted to become part of the community had a technical background or was used to tinkering with computers in an experimental fashion and used to reading documentation and using a CLI or editing configuration files. 

That isn't true anymore. The days of installing Linux and getting everything to work being a barrier to entry are over. New users no longer need to be familiar with xorg.conf or menu.lst, or how to blacklist Wi-Fi drivers for the most part. Linux just works, for an ever increasing variety of hardware configurations and most configuration can easily be done with GUI tools.

As a result, forums get more basic questions that previously would be fairly assumed as part of the base knowledge required to use Linux. This bothers any people that would prefer to keep the questions to be interesting and lead to a deepening of their understanding of how Linux functions. People that already know how to switch to a TTY or kill -9 an errant process and know how to troubleshoot basic issues can also assume that these things should be easy to find that information online. I have made the same mistake before myself. Domain specific knowledge seems like common sense if you're familiar with the domain.

I can (as always) only speak for myself as an individual Arch user.

I, for my part, like to help people and because of me, anyone who wants to use Arch is welcome to do so. 

However, if someone has a question, I expect them to ask it as smart as possible. Regardless of the topic. Many people nowadays want help as quickly as possible, but they usually don't provide enough information to help them. For example, instead of telling you the exact error message, they just tell you that they get an error message. Or I was able to find the solution of the problem with the help of the information mentioned in the post within a few seconds via Google.

\[Hard to install\] can mean both ""we are pros"" and ""we can't afford to pay devs to make it good"". 

I have a non-standart wirelesscard, and that is the very point where support ends - interestingly,though, BlackArch has really good autoinstallers. Why not the standart ARch? The mindset ""Do it step by step and you will learn something"" really sucks - I am not a sysadmin, I am a programmer. I do not care why program X needs config file Y - I want my environment to work.

I don't want to brag, but I am a decent programmer now after 10 years, and I always try to help newbies - and I often got something in return \[""here, have this class / script I wrote, look, it's awesome""\] -> I can't understand ""elitists"" either, but met them, many of them. They where all over the place in university, thinking because they wrote a single decent application made them gods -.- usually, they all fall, and they fall deep.

Sadly this made me boot Arch for good now, since my friend who uses it a lot (and who could not help me with said wireless card problems either) really made me like this OS.

I want to add that Debian never had any issues with my wireless setup, neither did Mint and any other Linux distro....

Which is funny because it's not even hard to do for a functional install.

But now I'm looking back at my first install as a fairly basic thing with much more I don't know or understand.

I've always found that as long as I explained my problem as specifically as possible, say what I've tried, and rather than expect an immediate fix ask 'where do I start to diagnose this', the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

The people helping aren't being paid, they owe you nothing, and are taking time out of their day to help you.

Why is the mindset around Arch so negative?,"I have something to add. A lot of the problem (IMHO) lies with the Arch Wiki. Arch wiki is fantastic...reference guide. But let's be honest, Its absolutely atrocious and terrible tutorial guide.

And when someone new comes - even with the honest mindset that he's willing to learn something, where does he learn? From the arch wiki? Don't be ridiculous.

Then the fact that beginners guide got purged for whatever ideological reason, there's no start point for a new user. When a new user does not know, what to look for, but gets refereed by trolls to RTFM/arch wiki, it's disgusting. 

Coupled with the fact that arch by design tries to be as agnostic a possible by default and not have any specific use case, it actually *does not* have any use case by default. And when a user comes and asks what should he install he gets responded by (honest, but completely useless response) ""whatever you want"", and if he inquires further, he just gets replied with RTFM, which takes us back.

Now - my own personal experience with the community when I was starting (cca 5 years back), was mostly negative. But not in the toxic way - no. I had many problems and I tried to be a good user, I tried to do my research through wiki, read up what was possible, tried solutions, then post a support request on the forums and...nothing. I've had over a dozens of problems I wanted to help with and I've never had any useful response which would help me. The only threads which got any response are threads with absolutely beginner stuff, but once you got anything moderately complicated and you post your question well enough so nobody can bitch about how wrong your question is, then suddenly crickets. The only time a non-trivial thread gets any response is when OP forgets to post their social security number or their boxers size. That's when trolls get their share of saying ""we can't help you when you don't tell us about your system"" and then they leave you without when you oblige.

I dare you to look up my account of forums (the same handle as here on reddit) and look up my support requests and see how many have any useful responses in them.

What kinds of answers do you expect here? After you've installed Arch, it is YOUR OS, same with every other OS. You install the stuff which YOU want and NEED. If you need recommendations, then even the wiki has two big wiki pages linked on its home page, namely the [General recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations) and [List of applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications). Asking ""which DE/WM"" should I install or ""which media player is the best"" is just personal preference based on the use case.

Why is the mindset around Arch so negative?,"This is turned into a wall of text, but I feel like it sums up the issue many people have with the Arch forums for those who don't seem to understand what our problem with it is.

Yesterday I was trying to help a friend solve an issue, she had just moved to Linux and since she's a glutton for punishment, just wiped Windows entirely and jumped headfirst into Arch. Kicked total ass, needed very little help after some initial explanations to get her rolling, she's up and running within a day and loves it. But she ran into an issue trying to build something from the AUR, she couldn't import the key because the keyserver was apparently down, but we didn't know that at the time. The only two error messages we could get were something like ""general error"" and ""Valid data not found."" Not very helpful, and we assumed something was broken on her system. I could have helped her just bypass the key entirely, but I wanted to solve the underlying issue.

After we dug around for a fair bit, we found [someone else had just posted with the same error](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=257441), and the first response was just a [link to the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg#Signature_checking) about the signature check process. Not helpful in the slightest, because the actual error is still a mystery. If you don't know what's wrong, you can't actually solve it.

Someone else posts about the keyserver being down, which is *actual useful information* unlike a brief blurb about signature checking on the wiki. OP takes the hint and figures out the issue, we do the same and all is good. Reply Guy #1 replies again with ""Did you bother to read the link I posted in #2 - that is exactly what the wiki stated.""

This is the kind of thing people don't like about the Arch Forums. Yeah, you linked a wiki page which then links *another* wiki page which *technically* did hold the solution that was eventually applied. Here's the issue: OP didn't ask for help copying and pasting commands off the wiki at random. They asked about a specific error which was not explained on the wiki, and after about an hour of two of us searching, neither of us came to the conclusion that these errors could indicate a server outage, so OP likely didn't know that either. So how would they know which solution from the wiki applies to their situation? Unless you expect other people to just paste things at random like a script kiddie until something works, that kind of response is not helpful in the slightest.

This guy has 28,000 posts, and he absolutely fits the stereotype of the unhelpful greybeard running arch with a tiling wm and vim. That last part isn't conjecture, he links screenshots in his own forum sig. I don't like calling people out directly, but people wanted an example and I had one that just occurred a day prior. Tons of threads are like this. Someone posts with a cryptic error and they get a link to the wiki in which the error is not mentioned whatsoever. That wiki page often does contain a solution to the problem, but that does nothing to help with connecting the problem to the correct solution.

In my experience, such cases are much less likely (but not impossible since there are always idiots) if questions are asked as smart as possible.

But in certain cases I can understand the frustration of the people helping. For example when questions are not or only partially answered. Or when one really has to beg for every information. If you've been playing this game for years, you'll get tired of it. For my part, I prefer to leave the discussion completely in such cases rather than start personal attacks. But if everyone who wants to help does so, then at some point there will be nobody left who can help. 

Therefore, both bearings should move more towards each other. In my opinion, the camp of those seeking help should take a bigger step.

Nobody (at least not me) demands that the question has to be asked perfectly. But even a beginner should be able to provide the following information on his own:

- Distribution and package version used (If it plays a role also which hardware)
- Description of the problem (""does not work"" is not a description)
- Error message (if available) in text form (not as screenshot)
- What has already been tried to solve the problem?

These points alone would help a lot.

And yes, in my opinion that is something you can expect even from a beginner. For my part, I, for example, can drive a car, refill oil and water for the windscreen wiper. Not much more either. Nevertheless, I can explain any problems I may have as detailed as possible to the employee in a workshop.

OpenSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, Mint, and so many others welcome feedback, open discussion, general questions, helpful replies, and contributions. Not only welcomed, but it is encouraged. Yet you don't find that with Arch.

I think that's sad. 

The OS as a whole is a lot easier to install than most folks give it credit. The software, once configured, is easy to update and pretty stable for a rolling release. Arch Linux and the many distros based upon Arch Linux often show some of the many things that can be achieved with Linux.

Why is the mindset around Arch so negative?,"> At the end of the day though I don't want to spend all day maintaining my system. 

And that's why I use Arch.  I configure it at the outset to work the way I want to, and don't have to worry about having my config changed by software updates, or tearing the system apart to find what's setting the auto-configured default that I never had the option to change at install.

I had this experience a few years ago in a business environment -- I had my own Arch box and several other Ubuntu workstations, all of which I wanted to configure to use LDAP for PAM login.  With Arch, it took me all of 10 minutes to read the docs on LDAP config and then set everything up properly.  With Ubuntu, I had to go through a cumbersome, distro-specific set of menus to configure LDAP, and when it didn't work correctly, it took me over an hour of research to figure out where the actual config settings that I needed to adjust were.

The problem with stuff that ""just works"" out of the box is that it only ""just works"" for specific use cases that the developers had in mind -- even a slight change away from the defaults means you have to put in vastly more time and effort to get past the extra layer of complexity meant to make things ""easy"" in order to get to the actual functionality of the thing.

And I came from Gentoo forums, there they were always very strict, but never aggressive and always informative, you asked a already answered question, you would be corrected and the proper link given with the added RTFM or please check before making a question; when asked for something about Sabayon (derived distro) they tried to help anyway with the disclaimer that may not be the same for Sabayon, do that in an Arch forum asking something Manjaro, you better close your account, terminate your contract with your ISP and burn your PC.

Why is the mindset around Arch so negative?,"🙄 You still ignored how people are helping (in a beneficial manner) and seem to be discouraged from doing so. Your whole post was focused on how newbies should ask questions.

Look, the last newbie I helped on the Arch forums was polite, clear, direct, and even painfully took the time to type out their logs manually and provided photos from their cell phone too. The answer they needed was not in the Wiki, nor was it something they could have Google'd.  I felt sorry for her/him being ignored, so I decided to help.

My answer both explained why they were receiving the error in LightDM, what the failure meant, what files they needed to edit, where they could find those files, and precisely what edits they needed to make. 

Do you know what went wrong according to the community at the time?

I suggest they edit their files using the terminal text editor nano. And that started the gatekeeping mindset about how vi or vim should be recommended. It was not a friendly side comment about how someone may prefer vi or vim better. It was 5+ users directly saying I had no idea what I was talking about and should not be giving advice because I don't know the ""right"" editor to suggest. -- Pure gatekeeping. 

And this was not even a direct personal attack since this was a dummy account with my 1st post. No one knew who I was or anything of my skills, minus the fact that I suggested nano.  All they should have known from their perspective was here was a newbie who was helping another newbie, both of them being friendly, clear, direct, and informative. -- What should be the ideal scenario.

Then the staff chimed in on how both of us should defer to the wiki. None of which addressed the issue they were having. The Wiki offered no working solution, nor did it cover the problem that was being discussed. 

Let me tell you right now. People are as detail as possible for two reasons. 1) So they can receive or give help as best as possible. 2) So should anyone know or face the issue themselves, they have a reference. 

Now, if those reasons are discouraged and not welcome, what is the point even to have a forum? Better question, why even be part of the Linux experience? Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Gentoo, and many more Linux distros would both welcome and are thankful when people act and think accordingly. Yet Arch would just as quickly piss on that mindset.

You can downvote this post until you are blue in the face. It will not change the fact.  This will also be my last reply to this thread.

That was a separate issue from him reinstalling the keyring entirely as a last-ditch effort (also some other issue he's having with outdated packages, not sure on that) but it was borne from him misunderstanding the keyring, yes. Both issues trace back to the error in the thread title, which was from gpg being unable to reach the keyserver but giving an extremely unhelpful error. Solving that solved everything for him. He even mentioned trying to change keyservers in `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf` so he was clearly on the right track originally, he just wasn't aware that makepkg didn't use that config.

After spending an hour looking around and running out of ideas, we also eventually tried reinstalling the archlinux-keyring like he did as a last ditch effort before finding that post, but that was because we were left thinking she somehow broke gpg itself while messing around and were trying to do anything we could to either reinitalize it or get a more helpful error message, including generating a key pair and reinstalling and repopulating pacman's keyring. It wasn't until we saw the server being down made us double back and try just running it with `--keyserver` instead of changing the config and she was back in business.

The point being that, same with us, all he needed to know was that the server was down. That immediately cleared up the confusion, he found how to solve his own issue (even if he didn't still fully understand it, but who fully understands every piece of software they run) and all was good.

That is where I fundamentally disagree: OP, unlike you, didn't use the correct command to get the key at all, everything related to the keyserver error is secondary until this is fixed. For all we know, their `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` might already contain a working keyserver, so the issue would be fixed simply by using the correct command, while changing `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf` does absolutely nothing in this situation.

It's a bit like asking (I am grossly exaggerating, obviously) ""I want to setup my printer in Linux, but when I boot, I get the error message 'Windows encountered an error BAD_DRIVER and needs to restart', what do I do?""

You can not only specify multiple search engines and set their nicknames to do a search like `d linux` for searching linux on Duckduckgo but you can completely specify the search and suggestion url and adding more private search options such as POST (for those engines that support it). The POST method combined with no redirect makes sure your search terms are hidden from the search engines and are not stored in local history. Vivaldi also supports ability to select a search engine when searching from page selection (it when you select and right click a word or phrase to search) which is AFAIK not available without plugins/extensions in most major browsers.

Report: Facebook exploited a 0-day media player bug in Tails linux OS to help FBI arrest a California man exploiting underage users,"To me, this part is curious: ""an upcoming Tails update was slated to strip the vulnerable code"".

Responsible disclosure would always dictate informing the maintainers. However, the fact that the vulnerability is already disappearing makes it somewhat of a moot point.

It's not entirely moot because that knowledge would probably still be of some use to the maintainers. They might release a fix more quickly and/or warn users to avoid old versions.

So I can almost understand why they would feel it isn't as necessary as it normally would be. But what I can't understand is why they wouldn't just go ahead and inform them as a matter of standard practice. The usual nefarious reason to avoid informing about a vulnerability is so that you can keep using an exploit, but that doesn't seem to apply here, because Facebook apparently knew that wasn't going to happen anyway.

Since that wasn't what was stopping them, what was? Did they not want to tip off the maintainers that they were looking at the software?

Report: Facebook exploited a 0-day media player bug in Tails linux OS to help FBI arrest a California man exploiting underage users,">Responsible disclosure would always dictate informing the maintainers. However, the fact that the vulnerability is already disappearing makes it somewhat of a moot point.

No it doesn't since, bug disclosure is about more than just purely the code being there. Weakness disclosure can lead the developers to look at the type of exploit/bug and go trough rest of the system or even other systems looking and fixing for similar exploits.

Like F the guy, but once he was caught the purpose of the exploit was completely gone. At that point the best possible security practice should resume. Which means responsible disclosure of the exploit. Which not only means ""hey that bit is broken"", but also ""this is how it is broken and how the exploit works"". As said which will lead to wider correcting of similar problems.

""Well they fixed it"" isn't an answer, since maybe they didn't actually fix it. Maybe the code change had nothing to do with the exploit being understood and thus the developers are robbed of rest of the insight. Maybe they reintroduce same type vulnerability again, since well they didn't actually fix it and don't know they shouldn't introduce such things to the system.

> the open and extremely fragmented nature of Linux makes these kinds of exploits inevitable.

Rather, it makes them expensive and of limited use.  This exploit targets one application of one distribution.  Had he used mpv rather than VLC, the exploit would not have worked.  Had he used Knoppix, grml, sysresc, or CentOS, it likely would not have worked.  Had he built VLC from source using clang, it certainly would not have worked.

MacOS exploits are not profitable anymore, because any of them works on all installations, and anyone interested in MacOS exploits already has at least one.

Windows is a bit more fragmented:  It runs on AMD as well as Intel, 32 and 64 bit, and there are still instances of XP and 7 in the wild.  But most applications have only two builds, one for 32 and 64 bit each.  Common targets of exploits are applications running with admin privileges, such as software firewalls and virus scanners.

> anyone can verify billions lines of code, but it takes an extremely significant amount of effort.

Indeed.  And this effort is highly automated, and several high-profile companies are deeply invested in it.  The livelihood of competing multinational companies depends on the integrity of a widely shared open source code base.

Report: Facebook exploited a 0-day media player bug in Tails linux OS to help FBI arrest a California man exploiting underage users,"That is roughly 80% true.

Tor is *not* hardened against statistical traffic-pattern attacks.

If you have

- A view into the target cleartext traffic (ideally you control the service itself)
- A view into the target user (ideally you control the gateway node, but an ISP tap would be good enough)

You can potentially unmask TOR users.

Basically, based on packet ~~size~~ and timing, you can identify what user is getting that traffic.  For example, if you control the hidden service, you could shape your traffic.  If someone downloads a 1MB image, TOR splits that into 2000 512B chunks.  If you were to send it to the target user as ~120 sets of 17 packet bursts, with 0.1s delays between them.

Meanwhile, you monitor the output stream(s).  When you find someone who is getting sets of 17 appropriately sized packets (they will be larger, because headers), you have your target.

Sure, it's entirely possible that you will get some false positives for packets in a row, and other traffic can mask the pattern with extra goods.  However, it's *extremely* unlikely for that to happen hundreds of times in a row.

Even if you don't control the specific target traffic, services have a ""signature"".  If you load `google.com`, it will send you 8 (? I forget) packets in a row.  The home page looks the same to everyone, and it has the same traffic pattern to everyone that visits it.

The defense against this is to rate limit packets, and to fill in the empty spaces with garbage data.  That way, nobody can tell if you're getting real data or not, because there's a continuous flow of packets between yourself and your gateway node.

If Facebook wasn't involved, then the victim still could have sent it without Facebook's knowledge or consent.

Report: Facebook exploited a 0-day media player bug in Tails linux OS to help FBI arrest a California man exploiting underage users,"OK, first of all, the statement doesn't make any sense. Security is situational and a VM can be used as an additional security layer.

What do you mean by security? I'd say it is a measure of how hard it is to retrieve your private data and do actions on your behalf. Obviously just taking an OS and putting it in a VM doesn't help security, but let's analyze this situation: 
I have a communication channel with someone who I want to keep the conversation private. So what I do is, I create 2 VMs one for my private data the other is for internet browsing. Now, to reach my private data there are 2 options: 

1. Breach the communication channel directly. (Unlikely as the connection is assumed secure)
2. Breach my browsing, then use a guest-to-host vulnerability to breach the host and from there see all of my private conversations.

In this situation, adding the VM clearly added a layer of security, hardening the easiness of getting my data.

Secondly, in the situation of tails I didn't really claim it adds ""security"". I said exactly what 3 things it will add.

Or you could have two separate user accounts.  Or run your web browser in a jail.

The first is built into the OS, for the specific purpose of protecting your data.

The latter is only a mitigation that protects against the simplest of attacks.

Or  simply encrypt your private conversation with OTR or a pass phrase.

Van Eck phreaking.

> 2. Breach my browsing, then use a guest-to-host vulnerability to breach the host and from there see all of my private conversations.

If you enable JavaScript, your browser is already running random code from random sources.  This potentially includes exploits for reading your physical memory.

If your conversation is visible this way, maybe close your browser first if you want to keep it private.

> Secondly, in the situation of tails I didn't really claim it adds ""security"".

So you don't regard your location, your hardware, and your application data to be private data nor relevant to security.

In that case, those are not things relevant to the design of Tails.

> Actually, you said that a VM is globally useless in terms of security, so explain to each of the three points, why a VM wouldn't solve it?

1. A VM does not change your location, or your visible IP address.

2. A VM may emulate a diffferent hardware.  That doesn't change the physical hardware (and its vulnerabilities), and may add security holes of the emulatef hardware as well.  It is likely to add its own vulnerabilities as well.  In short:  A VM increases the attack surface.

3. The OS provides some level of sandboxing between applications:  Each process has its own virtual memory, its own stack, its own permissions (file and otherwise), its own resources.  A VM adds nothing in that regard, it only increases the resource usage for virtually identical resources.

If you want to limit the visibility of files, that is what file permissions are for.  The VM adds nothing in that regard.

>If you enable JavaScript, your  browser is already running random code from random sources.  This  potentially includes exploits for reading your physical memory.

This is exactly why a VM adds to your security, the VM itself can't read the physical memory even whith guest-root premissions, so no matter what code you run in the browser, it'll have to use a guset-to-host vulunarbility to actually read the physical memory. Again, what you just said supports my calim. This is exactly why a VM adds to your security.

>If your conversation is visible this way, maybe close your browser first if you want to keep it private.

Ok, this is the most important thing. \*\*By closing the browser you achieve NOTHING!! If any mallicious code was ran it is pretty basic that is also installed a backdoor on your computer, and it will keep spying on you after you closed the browser.\*\*

>A VM does not change your location, or your visible IP address.

No, it doesn't, neither I ever claimed it does. But, given root access to a debian VM guest on a tails host, you won't be able to get the geo ip. However given root on a tails system, you will be able.

> A  VM may emulate a diffferent hardware.  That doesn't change the physical  hardware (and its vulnerabilities), and may add security holes of the  emulatef hardware as well.  It is likely to add its own vulnerabilities  as well.  In short:  A VM increases the attack surface.

This has nothing to do with what I said in point 2. I was talking about hardware recognition. That is, Serial Numbers and other unique identifiers of hardware such as MAC addresses and etc. A VM hides the actual value of them by giving either a random (changeable) or a standard one, that many people share. This increases your anonymity by allowing you to do 2 actions from the same platform with a different fingerprint every time. 

>The  OS provides some level of sandboxing between applications:  Each  process has its own virtual memory, its own stack, its own permissions  (file and otherwise), its own resources.  A VM adds nothing in that  regard, it only increases the resource usage for virtually identical  resources.

Yes, but by default, by breaching into a user account and being able to run arbitrarily code, an attacker can access all user-premissioned files \*and actions\*.  There are better solutions then a VM for somethings (SELinux and AppArmor), and you are correct that a VM increases the attack surface but saying a VM doesn't adds security because in some situations there is a better solution, is plain and simple stupid.

All electric and electronic devices radiate radiation as they operate.  Computers and computer peripherals are electronic devices.  From their radiation, their operations can be reconstructed, like for example the image on your screen.

>> This  potentially includes exploits for reading your physical memory.

> This is exactly why a VM adds to your security

The physical memory is the same for the VM.

> the VM itself can't read the physical memory

Neither can your browser.  So the VM adds nothing.

But exploits running in your browser may be able to read your physical memory.  And I don't mean virtual memory, or what the VM pretends is the physical memory, but the actual physical memory.

> By closing the browser you achieve NOTHING!!

Possible.  There is a difference between running random code in your browser that spies on you, and runing code that uses a privilege escalation exploit to install and forks its own daemon.

If you are worried about the latter, you can only disable JavaScript, or not use your browser at all.  Or use Tails and reboot your computer between using your browser and any other application.

Or use two physically separate machines.

>> A VM does not change your location, or your visible IP address.

> But, given root access to a debian VM guest on a tails host, you won't be able to get the geo ip.

Sure you will.  Because neither your visible IP nor your location changes.

>> A VM increases the attack surface.

> I was talking about hardware recognition.

So does the OS.  Usually you need special privileges to read those.  And to change them.

 > This increases your anonymity by allowing you to do 2 actions from the same platform with a different fingerprint every time.

Fingerprinting is very rarely done with serial numbers.  Or hardware information beyond the type of CPU.

Most applications don't care about serial.numbers anyway.  The OS abstracts the differences between different hardware.  Serial numbers simply don't matfer.  MAC addresses are visible on the local (and only the local) network, because the ethernet protocol requires it, but the OS can set those to arbitrary values as well, if you think it matters.

How would you suggest to breach an account?

 > saying a VM doesn't adds security because in some situations there is a better solution, is plain and simple stupid.

It doesn't add security because it doesn't do anything in the way of security that isn't done by the OS anyway.

What you developers and software engineers do is little less than magic. Thank you.,"There are definitely parts of programming that are more like research, and there are definitely parts that are more like engineering. There’s quite a bit that we do understand about software and quite a bit of other people’s work that we do get to benefit off of without thinking about (most people don’t write their own operating systems or languages anymore).

The part about Linux is also misleading. Linux is a tremendous project, but the vast majority of code in Linus is driver code for the huge array of devices that Linux supports. The kernel itself isn’t small, but it’s also nowhere near 30 million lines.

The ingenuity required around programming is more around constantly modifying a program while it’s in operation. That’s where software really differs from any physical engineering medium I know of. Yea, bridges get maintenance work and repairs while they’re still being traveled over, but their structure stays the same. A program’s structure is constantly being rearranged. And there’s never a pattern from migrating from structure A to structure B. 

Sure, we have Refactoring by Martin Fowler, but those tend to be smaller scale refractors. Often we need to replace or dissipate an entire subsystem into different components. There’s almost never a manual or precedent to follow when doing that. That’s why things like estimation are so pointless for tasks like that. You could be off by an order of magnitude easily.

What you developers and software engineers do is little less than magic. Thank you.,"A compiler splits the text file into tokens. The literals `5` and `""yeet""` are **tokens**, as are `{`, `}`, `+`, and `your_variable_name`, for example.

The compiler then checks whether all the *tokens* are in the right order and if they make any sense. If so, they put it into an internal data structure for later use, that represents your program in memory.

The compiler will then take this data structure, and optionally do a ton of transformations on it. Some might be optimize it, and others might change the data structure into a simpler one that's easier to operate on.

Once all of this is done, it translates that data structure into **assembly code** (i.e. operations your computer directly knows how to do), which is then assembled into an actual **binary object file**. Do this to each file, and **link** all the files together. At this point, your OS handles the rest of turning your program into a process.

---

The first step, with the tokens, is called **lexing**, and I learned how to do it with regular expressions/regexes (common programmer thing, you should just look this one up).

The second step is called **parsing**, and is basically solved by now, but most compiler classes teach this step too much, instead of going into the meat of it, the third step. The data structure your compiler uses is called an **Abstract Syntax Tree**, or **AST**.

The third step, is those **transformations and optimizations**. The fourth step is called **codegen**. Your compiler will typically invoke a separate program for assembling and a separate program for linking, though.

---

Interpreters skip the transformations and codegen, and basically are a giant recursive if block on each expression in your code, and are thus slow as fuck. They're easy to write and small, though, and thus much easier to write correctly. One good use is to check for compiler correctness.

Scripting languages like Javascript and Python muddy the waters, and Java itself isn't clear either.

Java compiles to something else instead of normal assembly, like x86_64 or ARM, but rather to Java Bytecode, which is its own form of assembly. The java executable you download then compiles this bytecode to e.g. x86_64 as it runs!

With Python, there are actual several different implementations, but most people use CPython, which is the one you download off the site. This is an interpreter, though it's funky in its own way, that blurs the lines a bit. There's a JIT compiler (Just In Time) implementation, which is what Java does, called PyPy, which is much faster.

With Javascript, there's several different implementations, but Chrome's is called V8, which is also a JIT compiler.

JIT compilers are much faster than interpreters, and end up created to replace interpreters. They're also typically optimizing compilers, so they'll figure out how to optimize your code further, while it runs, based on how it's performing (your normal C compiler can do this, it's called profiling, but typically isn't necessary; your compilers normal optimizations are typically good enough).

So yeah, there's a massive amount of work going on here. A lot. But it's also really cool work! I really recommend that you take a compilers class when you get to that level.",8,linux,Green0Photon,

It is true that we re-use the work of others, which is like engineering. I would say design patterns also fall in this category, as do frameworks and libraries. Nevertheless, you do not design and build a bridge using agile project management and certainly not build it this way. The project management that works so well for bridges was found to be useless for software development exactly because software development is inherently a process more akin to research than to engineering.

I'm not really claiming software development is pure research, I am saying that the thought processes involved are more akin to that than to classic engineering. Classic engineering is more alike infrastructure development in the IT world than software development. We went through a stage where only 30% of software development projects were ever completed until we understood the difference, but the awareness is still missing, as many developers are still taught to pretend that we do engineering whilst engaging in a research type of activity.

I know I've seen that first hand in a whole bunch of industries. Still, some are way better (usually), e.g. space industry or high-energy physics research.

>There's no engineering before making the software. In a lot of places, testing after the software is made is lacking: those are the good companies. Most companies don't have any real test infrastructure.

That's where I will disagree: there is too much ""thinking"" about how it should for, in the end, using the wrong programming language (for example) for your use case or loosing the team in a development paradigm that few even care about. At the end of the day, using the wrong tool in your belt will give you a poor result, that's for sure. And I see too many (wannabe) developers preaching for what they've learned at school/they like instead of what would be right.

I diverge but this would explain (partly) why functional programming never took off, and it's one example among many.

Regarding the testing, I somewhat agree with you, but to be fair: no one is really trained for testing at the scale the software will be used for usually (except for some industries like I said previously) and, contrary to other stuff, IMHO, there is no proper methodology, framework or environment to do so, currently.

>And product-critical code is often stored in zip files on some dude's laptop that might be stolen from his car any minute. There's no backup.

Again, to me, that's an exaggeration. But I agree with you about backups on the big picture. And, again, like I said before, when developers are taught and think that backups are data stored on one and only RAID5 storage server without UPS, at the very least, that's very concerning. I know some colleagues in some critical environments that do not use version control system...

But still: it's even worse when it comes to research. Should we say that ""research is magical""?

I get what you are saying and I mostly agree but, still, it's like you're being too salty, IMHO. If you were even half-right GNU/Linux, BSD OSes would not even exist (yes, I know at least what you are gonna say about testing - don't, please) so it's not all that dark and gloomy.

What you developers and software engineers do is little less than magic. Thank you.,"I'd strongly agree with this.

Mathematicians, in my view, introduce some bad habits into programming, based on good intentions.

Namely, they tend to prioritise maximum compactness and concision over clarity and verbosity. The desire to reduce things to their absolutely most economical and minimal form of expression is a good motivation, and things that are small are elegant, but in programming it leads to unnecessary difficulty if the principal is extended to a fanatical degree.

Consider most examples you see of algorithms in many textbooks etc., in whatever code/pseudocode they like. Rather than use self-descriptive and helpful terms, instead all of the variables and iterators will end up being called i,j,k,p,q,r etc, making what they represent completely opaque.

Making code a little more verbose so that it is self-describing, making nomenclature and terminology a little more expanded than is absolutely necessary makes life a lot easier. And finally, on top of that, code should always be well commented. I think the assumption that whoever is reading it ""should just be able to figure it out"" is a really bad habit, IMO. Adding a descriptive line to your function or in critical/complex parts of code adds literally seconds (since 99% of your time is spent figuring stuff out/fixing the bugs) in the process, but could save another person (or yourself, if you haven't read your own code in months/years) countless hours.

Mathematics is beautiful but brutally, brutally  terse. Good code should be economical and elegant, but not to the point where it is opaque and impossibly complicated to untangle. This is where I think mathematics can go to far. Code should blend mathematical elegance with the poetry and communicative power of natural language.",6,linux,Sonnilon81,

If you're getting attacked by a lot of patent trolls, then there is something else going on. 

\> What is your long time strategy at making sure this practice is abolished in both for-profit and non-profit alike?

This is really a Neil question, but I'll answer it from my perspective. The long term plan is really then to create alliances with other projects, organizations and companies. One thing, you'll need to understand is that these patent trolls are actually attacking a toolchain. That's risk. That means if a company is using some library or application as part of their product that could be problematic for them. So should be highlighted as a concern.

We can also work iwth organizations like High Tech Inventors Alliance. But ultimately, we need to form strategies where an attack on one is an attack on everyone. That will de-incentivize patent trolls. Because a) non-profit like ours are not very lucrative to begin with, we dont have money b) it will bring more trouble than it is worth.

If you're doing a shake down for $60k, and then you pay $120k in legal fees and lose (as we are trying to do here) then it's not a very good business decision. Patent trolls count on you to make it go away, but if we are not willing to do that but actually prove to be aggressive then they'll be less likely to look at us. That's the idea anyways.

In the meanwhile, long term, build alliances. We need to do that anyways. That's why I help start Linux Application Summit. We can no longer work as silos, we need to start building partnerships going forward.",71,linux,blackcain,

Those are example of ""puns"", which are generic commands that acts completely differently based on the subject/object given.

TIFU case-study: destroying a SSD with IO problems,">\- Buying an DRAM-less SSD.  
This is uncertain as far as my knowledge goes, but maybe, just maybe, the SSD firmware would not write all those transactions as fast as they occurred. Instead they could've been written in bulk or allow the LVM caching to write them directly to the HDD.  
To my defense it was hard to find a definitive answer if a not-top-tier disk has DRAM or not (unless it's hidden under the term ""cache"").

Just a bit info on DRAM-less SSD:

DRAM on SSD is mainly used to store the table that translates the LBA (addressing used by your host PC) and the NAND physical address during run-time. The ratio between the table and capacity is about 1:1000. This means 1TB drive requires about 1GB DRAM. 

A lot of SSD and SSD controller companies came up with some techniques to avoid using DRAM, but instead just store the translation table in the memory internal to the controller. This done mainly due to cost but also sometimes due to the PCB real estate. So based on those two factors if the SSD is pretty cheap and/or it is a small form factor (gum stick), very likely it does not use DRAM.

While DRAM-less SSDs usually have lower performance, they are not necessarily more prone to data integrity issue. While storing the translation table in the internal memory gives the controller faster access, this internal memory is very small compared to DRAM, this means  more swapping between the NAND and internal RAM that cause more writes to the NAND.",5,linux,gdata,

You boot, some stuff needs to be in ram, but you dont use it for most of the time (BT and its libraries, audio subsystem, some icon data etc.) this may be swapped out but not accessed too frequently.

* RAM and CPUs got faster, but hard disks didn't and SSDs still aren't really close enough to make things feel like the 90's -- as you point out, even on an SSD, the system is probably grinding to a halt when you start using swap seriously.

1. You're running a ""workstation"" in a situation where the power frequently goes out, but
2. You don't have a UPS (you're not even running this on a laptop).
3. The power outages are predictable enough for you to suspend to disk ahead of time.

Normally, people solve #3 by using a UPS, so your workstation can be notified that it has X seconds of battery life left, and that might just be enough time to shutdown. If you have *that,* then suspend-to-disk makes sense.

I wasn't even talking about the waste of space. I'm talking about the failure mode when you run out of RAM.

With swap = system becomes unresponsive and has to be forcibly rebooted (forcing you to waste time loading all the crap that you were working on).

To be clear, what I'm describing is more or less how I'd configure a workstation. It'd make *more* sense to me on VMs, where it can make a difference when trying to squeeze into the tiniest one.

(And, FWIW, being able to reload what you were working on as automatically as I can recreate a VM ought to be a life goal. You do have to reboot for kernel updates anyway, right?

The amount of write amplification is very different. Files are split into data block, you only need to rewrite the changing blocks.

* For normal file operation: Buffered I/O will take care of most small writes and batch them up before asking the disk controller to write them down.
* For swap file: The page replacement algorithm often swap out/swap in multiple page at once.

In both case, the OS does not ask the disk controller to write a single block, it asks the disk controller to write a list of blocks. The controller can group them up and write them into a SSD, thus there are no wasted write.

Another details that you missed is an SSD block only need to be erased, not written as a whole. Each block is divided into a number of pages (not to be confused with memory page), and it's those pages that must be written as a single unit.

Theoretically, it lacks nothing to run without QEMU (in fact the initial images were ran on raw hardware before resorting to QEMU). Some effort needs to be done to get smdev/nldev/nlmon/nltrigger working (their s6-rc service files are present, but they're the first thing I'll be working on once I get a working graphics stack which would take some time).

Regarding firmwares, well since this is a musl based distribution, you can't expect it to have the proprietary NVIDIA drivers for example, but since it's extremely lightweight and highly optimized, you may notice a decent increase in the performance of the open-source NVIDIA driver nouveau (I understand this may not be needed, but still better than nothing).

The new design is heavily inspired by Musl-LFS toolchains.

I think it is a bit of Dunning-Kruger effect, many people (especially teenagers) new to Linux start to get a bit arrogant after they start to get more comfortable with the command line and have done a bit of ricing. This doesn't make them an expert hacker or a sysadmin or a software engineer but they think they are an expert with just that little bit of knowledge, and they seem to think that gives them license to laugh at people who don't know as much as they do.

I am a professional software engineer with a masters in computer science and over 10 years of experience, and I occasionally post comments that are a bit controversial -- like calling Emacs an ""app platform"", or refering to the Python REPL as a ""shell"", or saying things like ""some apps are so simple they are obviously bug free"", or ""sometimes making an app faster means optimizing it to run on more cores.""

Make a monumental effort to stop being a dick,"I've used Linux for over 24 years, but it has only been my default desktop OS for 22 years. What you are describing is true, there are a lot of asshats in the Linux community at large that give new users a hard time and refuse to answer questions. It's been that way for the ENTIRE time that I have used Linux.

I'm not a developer, programmer, or network administrator. I did build computers, but trust me it's not that hard. It's like putting very expensive Legos together. It was through building computers that I discovered Linux. I didn't want to pay over $100 for a (legit) Windows license, and Linux was free. 

I fell in love with Linux very quickly. What I didn't fall in love with was some members of the community. It seems that there are just some ass clowns out there that feed themselves off of how many ""read the fucking manual (RTFM)"" posts that they can do in one day. Most of the time, they haven't RTFM themselves. If they did, they would know that some of your problems aren't in the manual. 

I had a very heated conversation with one of these jerks, were I posted parts of the manual (a manpage) verbatim to him/her showing that the manual didn't address my problem. I could tell by our interaction that he/she hadn't RTFM himself/herself. That person stop replying to me, then a MOD stepped in and asked me to submit a bug report. Eventually my issue was fixed. However,  I had had enough of the toxicity, and left Linux for about 6 months.

I eventually started using Linux again. It is an excellent operating system! It works well on just about everything you put it on, as long as the drivers exist. If you are coming with a computer that has Windows pre-installed, you usually don't see all of the trouble the manufacturer went through to get Windows running ""right"" on that machine. Since I used to build computers, I knew first hand how much of a pain it was. Linux is a lot easier, if the drivers are available. 

I think most of the problems with new users boil down to some of them not doing their homework before installing Linux. You need to know whether or not Linux supports your hardware BEFORE INSTALLING IT. Googling does help with this issue. Running a Linux distro from a liveCD or USB on your machine, then making sure everything works before hitting install also helps. 

New users should stay the hell away from Arch and most of its derivatives (that includes Manjaro). You have to know what you are doing just to install Arch. Since there is no ""liveCD/USB"" for Arch, you can't take that route to get around not knowing what to do. It's like trying to build a car from scratch and not having any mechanical skills. You need to read up first. Manjaro, which has liveCD/USBs for all of its derivatives is much easier. However, since Manjaro is based on Arch, you occasionally run into issues that are Arch related, and the only real help are the wikis. 

The Arch forums are totally useless. You essentially installed a custom OS on your hardware -- one that you built up from scratch. There are so many variables that arise from doing this that it is near impossible for someone else to help you. The Arch forum is just there to direct you to the wikis, and it's a hangout for RTFM trolls.

New users should also stay away from Distrowatch or take what's posted there with a grain of salt. Sometimes difficult to use distros rise to the top of the rankings based on the fads that plague the Linux community. The best distros for new users are Ubuntu or Ubuntu based derivatives (Linux Mint, PopOS, etc.). Stay away from the minimalistic fad or the tiling fad that is currently going on. That means don't install any i3 based distros, ElementaryOS, or just about anything that has ""vanilla"" GNOME in it. Stick to XFCE, Cinnamon, or KDE desktop based distros to start. Plus, as someone else mentioned, since Ubuntu caters to new users, its forums are a lot more friendlier.

The rude mods are a few people who comment a lot (I think some of them aren't even mods). There are like two people who comment on almost every post.

It's more of an Arch problem than a Linux problem, in my experience. Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, etc are pretty welcoming. It's a shame, because Arch is actually my favorite distro. It just happens to be a lightning rod for a certain type of self-important misanthrope.

At a certain point it doesn't matter if the right answer has been posted in the thread because no-one's going to wade through the crap to find it. (Arch isn't the worst at this: XDA developer threads can be 200 pages of people telling other people to read the thread and the answer you want is on page 153 in a footnote of a link in a post which is otherwise identical to all the other 'just google it' posts).",2,linux,rcxdude,

Hey linux users!I've been learning programming (C++) for about the last 6 months
 and plan to take computer science in uni which will be two years from now. On m
any of the sites I have been to people have said that if I want to expand my pro
gramming (as well as overall computer) knowledge I should get out of windows and
 move into Linux. I have an old Toshiba Satellite Pro 4200 series laptop that my
 uncle has stopped using so I thought that I would install the linux os on that.
 My problem is that I cannot seem to get windows 98 off the laptop. I have tried
 to go to the add/remove programs but there is no way to unistall it from there?
 What should I do. I have the cd from the most recent magazine, where they talk 
about being able to install linux on anything even a motorcylce? Surley we can g
et around this, I have a fully functional laptop but with no Internet. Any help 
that you can offer would be greatley apprieciated!Thank you,-Max

Hello Max.You don't need to look into W98. Just download the latest version of a
 Linux distribution like Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Xubuntu (or others). (preferably ""Li
ve CD""). Download it, burn the ISO image on a CD and put it in the laptop... tha
ts it. you can see it workin witout installing anything.  you can choose to inst
all from a icon in the demo desktop.I don't know how old you laptop is, but Ubun
tu and Kubuntu needs some power. I would like to suggest trying Xubuntu first (a
 light flavor of ubuntu). the main diffrence between U-K-X is the desktop manage
r. Just ask in forums or google your questions, is amazing how much is already a
nswered in the internet.You can always try another linux distro, but Ubuntu fami
ly has a nice balance between user friendlyness and available information.

This is in 2016, my first post on reddit, learning how devops works:

https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/51uvx4/7_weeks_before_applying_to_a_devops_jobinternship/

A user in that thread reached out to me and took time to mock interview me. He had brought up a cloud instance, started apache and nginx on the same instance, changed the `root` directive in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` configuration file, and also changed permissions on the `/var/www/html/index.html` file. He taught me about common configuration file locations, text filtering and processing, permissions, and managing services, about the importance of clear communication and repeatable examples. Two years later this same user is my mentor and we work together at the same company!

I'm going to throw a theory out there as to why this might be, _testosterone_ :P, I think that could be 90% of the issue. Another theory relates to the type of work we are doing, knowledge work which has many levels of abstraction and takes many skill sets to be _capable_ in. You learn different things and have different perspectives at different levels of experience and understanding, this will be constantly changing and often along the way you will feel you are in a current state of ""being right"". Everyone wants and has so much pressure to be right a lot of the time. Deadlines are so tight, the cost of errors still so high that it's often your personal crusade to be right. Good organisations are able to understand that what you implement and get working will always be wrong and iterating over time. When you learn something it involved bring many _chunks_ of knowledge into a new stream of thought for a new _chunk_. We've all been doing for how ever many years or months and lose knowledge of that learning experience, which results in a lack of empathy for our fellow workers/learners. This can create a lot of tension and causes a lot of people lash out at new people. Everyone's learning path is different, not everyone will know the exact same thing. This is not a downfall of your team/group/organisation/tribe, this should be a recognised as a positive. Diversification and different learning experiences and pathways can add a lot to your team, best(worst) of all you might find knowledge caps in your own learning, this can again upset people because they feel, as the _Senior_ blah-da-blah role that they should know the most and direct on decisions.


What makes this even worse is how _Heroes_ are rewarded and held in such high regards in a lot of organisations.. This is the worst aspect of work for me, working 60-80 hours a week,, no family or fewer family/life commitments, being the best at solving things as an individual and having to always be right... it's exhausting for everyone else, managers, they aren't that great. They are great for managed/professional service companies because projects don't have longevity and being able to produce short term results is so important but for the rest of us it sucks.


I'm with you, don't be a dick, if someone doesn't know something or has a different approach see this as an opportunity and put forth empathy as your first reaction. Show them an alternative option, your perspective. More often then not I've seen peoples arrogance(fear)  cause them to dig into only supporting their own solution but keep working with them, the team, see what you can get out of the experience and if need be, move on.

I read the handbook, but I still got a few problems while installing and the people on IRC were just wonderful; there was a person who spent 20 minutes of their time trying to help me. They also went the extra mile and gave me a few tips on things to do after I actually install and configure the system! <3

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for a lot of the experiences I have had in other GNU/Linux communities; we have a very toxic minority in our community that is very elitist and enjoys bringing down newbies.

Because of the experiences I had with other GNU/Linux communities, I was initially very hesitant to join the gentoo channel on freenode and ask my questions, but I was so pleasantly surprised.

I encountered other problems while installing that I was able to solve by googling and finding forum posts by other beginners who encountered similar problems. The feeling I got by reading the forum posts is that the Gentoo community is extremely friendly and welcoming to beginners.

I might be wrong, since I am new to Gentoo; maybe Gentoo also has an elitist and toxic minority, but the friendliness I experienced in the Gentoo community really left a wonderful taste in my mouth.

So, I guess the behavior OP is describing really depends on what community you are in and the kind of behavior the community encourages.

Unfortunately, the toxic and elitist behavior that a minority of the GNU/Linux community is plagued with is not limited to GNU/Linux; I've experienced similar things while studying computer-science. There are a lot of elitists and dicks in computer-science, as well. But one thing I realized is that truly knowledgeable people are usually very humble and friendly, because what I have realized is that the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. The elitist dicks are usually the ones who don't know as much as they want you to think, but they are insecure about their lack of knowledge and cover it up by pretending that newbies are beneath them.",2,linux,,

Make a monumental effort to stop being a dick,"I used to spend a lot of time on /r/tor because I love the technology and I love talking about it. However I don't so much anymore because of stupid questions.

What is a stupid question in this context? A stupid question is one that can be solved with 10 minutes or less of personal research.

Example stupid questions that I have seen recently:

* How do I install Ubuntu?
* How do I install a package with pacman?
* Where can I find a hospital in my city?
* How do I make X work on Windows 10  (in a Linux forum)?

This is disrespectful to the people on the subreddit and to their time because you didn't try to find it yourself.

There are also stupid answers. These are answers that are designed to insult, humiliate, or annoy the user.

* RTFM-Read The Friendly Manual (but I won't tell you where or which one)
* LMGTFY

Like most people, I'm guilty of both asking stupid questions and giving stupid answers. We're not perfect. We have bad days and sometimes we're a little lazy or in a bad mood. That's not an excuse for being a jerk to newbies or to expect someone to be your own personal Google.

One last thing:

Giving someone a concise link and description on how to answer a question isn't the same thing as telling someone to RTFM. **Don't expect someone to chew your food for you.** If you ask a basic question like how to install an application with pacman and you are given the pacman cheat sheet with all of the common commands, then say Thank You and find the one that you need.

Understand that the regular behavior of someone new at Linux is always ask instead of research. That's normal, we want fast answers, we live a era where everything needs to be fast. But as you read on the link I've posted Arch is not designed for beginners. It's not their core target audience.

For sure they don't discourage the newbies to come around but those fellas (like me few years ago) need to learn how to read the manual before hitting the forum. That behavior of not spending too much time reading manual or at least their Wiki tends to be very annoying for the actual audience (actual senior power users) because the distro is also on rolling release mode. So things tends to break if you just push buttons without reading the change logs first.

Don't come here asking ""Nasa"" to behave like ""kindergarden"" there's a minimal requirement to use distros like this one. Same goes if you decide to stop programming in high-level languages and go to Fortran or Assemble. There's a minimal requirements a maturity on specific aspects of computers to be there and its high.

I always recommend Fedora, SuSE and Ubuntu to beginners. They will eventually start feeling the need to go beyong UIs. They will hit the forum from those distro and start to accumulate knowledge on how to maintain a Linux based OS. They will eventually start craving for something more sophisticated.

Sorry if it sounds bit tough but i was there. Suffering ""bullying"" for not being able to try doing my homework first. After 6\~7 years on Arch Linux as my main distro i realized that posting new threads on Forums are just a waste of space most of the time. Solution is out there waiting to be read.

All i can say is that Arch Linux taught me how to be a actual power user. I Appreciate take the leap from Ubuntu to SuSE, from SuSE to Slackware and reaching Arch. It was rewarding.

I dont use it anymore. Currently on Fedora (never used before) and thinking on switch from the Workspace variation to Silverlight one. Can use it anymore because it gives too much freedom. Really easy to get addicted on spending time and more time ricing it. I just need something stable to work.

By the same token, someone who just dumps a stack trace and says my program has an error please help me fix it, and then they post the source code to some java class that clearly has not been reduced, that deserves a low effort response. It shouldn't be rude but criticism is definitely warranted in this case.

These communities are run by *volunteers* and *their* time should be treated with respect. I would go as far to say that it's actually bad to volunteer in these communities and have no filter with who you help. Because you're teaching others that low effort questions will be met with high effort responses, an unsustainable situation. It's akin to being vulnerable to an amplification attack in a way.

Make a monumental effort to stop being a dick,"I honestly think this is a user-generational thing.

Up until ~2003-2005, most linux users *were* highly technical CS or engineering people. It was a small, somewhat tight knit group of users who had the capability of solving problems themselves (for various reasons; system complexity was lower, average user skill was higher, many users coming from other unix-like systems). Usually you knew somebody personally, through your LUG or a colleague etc, who could help you w/ most issues.

In that gap until circa 2012, gnu/linux has grown up significantly and the huge swing toward web applications has made it dramatically more accessible to less technical users. Developers start getting a lot of the same basic questions, problem report quality drops, and we don't yet have good ecosystem tools to manage support for the much larger user-to-developer ratio. Developer-user interaction became a lot less personal because unless the user contributes, they don't stand out from the noise; social apathy/exhaustion sets in. New users try linux, can't get help, realize its not ready for them, and go back to what they were using before. For many, it only takes one bad interaction or one significant blocker to leave a bad taste, and it's happening far too often.

Post-2008 until now we get the stack overflow, askubuntu, archwiki generation. We started building much more readily searchable repositories for common user questions--user cookbook solutions instead of scanning mailing lists to figure out which combination finally resolved something. We have a lot higher awareness of keyword and link referral SEO, as well as user search bubbles. It has become acceptable--recommended even--to answer your own question with a solution. Users vastly outnumber developers now; telling users to ""read the source"" is fully nonsensical. A significant number of the long term users started in or suffered through the ""Can't get help"" period and identify/empathize more with other new users having problems than they do with developers. That empathy comes across in user-to-user interaction.

Arch is actually an interesting community because of what it is: the bleeding edge developer and early adopter users subgroup. It has the qualities from all three of my time periods because the users are a significant percentage developers, being bleeding edge means feature documentation is low and at the same time, the bug resolution rate is high and it generates FAQ documentation prodigiously.

Unfortunately soon enough the website was spammed, with no ill intent, by people looking for someone to do their homework, or asking questions that can be answered by reading the help (official docs) page of the function they're using. It became frustrating. Instead of being people who were faced with interesting problems or get to share their experience, these highly skilled people were faced with Google search queries instead. People asking questions didn't bother to Google it, to read the manual about the stuff they're trying to do, to read the error message, to at least try to solve their issue before asking someone else to do it, to at least write the question in a proper way.

People, naturally, became at first dismissive, and then aggressive towards these questions. And then you have people join on communities like DevRant, and say that stackoverflow is the worst site ever, full of dicks.

Apparently asking bad questions and not putting in any effort into understanding the problem was a common thing.

As a response to this, stackoverflow caved in and issued a new code of conduct that basically asked people not to be dicks. As a result good people lost interest in the website. Now, whenever I face any issues, and decide to ask about it, nobody pays attention. Instead, questions about how to write ""Hello World"" are the ones welcomed there.

I find a better way is to answer the question even if you suspect that they are doing things wrong - but also ask what they are trying to do and make a guess or two. Using your example-

“You can use ‘alien’ which you’ll probably need to install also. However installing rpms on Ubuntu is usually a last resort. Can you find a ‘deb’ package for it or have you used ‘apt search’ to see if you can install it directly with apt?

IMO when you decide to answer a question you are committing to help another person.

I also try to be extra nice since the person I’m trying to help can’t hear my tone of voice, see my body language, etc.

I almost never use the `man` command, because being blasted by screen after screen of monospace text is kind of like having to go outside and use a manual pump every time you want a glass of water.

If I really need to refer to a man page, I tend to get it from linux.die.net or from Ubuntu's manpage repository. At least the former is variable width text and the latter has some formatting, even if it's still monospace.

In my experience, most man pages also tend to be pretty lackluster in showing examples or giving you a guide as to how to actually put the thing into practice.

It lays out some clear use-case examples and shows the commands you would use, and then it lays out in detail each flag and how it operates.

None of those have made real attempts at solving the underlying infrastructure that is needed for a drag-and-drop application experience like on the Mac.

Actually, some user may not like having an Apps Folder or other may not like having the Firts Run assistant. Therefore they are not forced to install it. Also as you may appreciate the First Run dialog is pure Qt and some GNome user may not like having Qt stuff on their system. Therefore a Gtk version could be made for those peoples.

"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","One way to think about niche pulseaudio fills is that it's a windowing system (aka compositor) for audio. Just like a windowing system allows several graphic buffers to be seen on a single video output at once, a sound compositor allows several sound sources to be heard on a single output.  It's not a multiplexer however, in the sense most people understand multiplexing.

The idea of a sound compositor itself is perfectly fine, pretty much has to be done to allow multiple apps to produce sound at the same time. It's the implementation details in pulseaudio that draw most of the criticism.

ALSA means two mostly unrelated things, causing a lot of confusion. There's a kernel interface (a bunch of ioctl that work on devices in /dev/snd) which is called ALSA, and then there's a very extensive userspace library also called ALSA or sometimes alsalib. The kernel interface is fine. The library is not. It's not just a bunch of wrappers for the kernel interface, it does a lot of stuff including limited multiplexing and mixing which really, really shouldn't be done in a library. To make matters worse, it happens to be the default way to get the ioctl wrappers, so people who'd be rather talking to the kernel interfaces directly end up linking and depending on all that userspace stuff as well.

One question that I never managed to find a good answer to wrt audio in Linux, is what about hardware-assisted mixing? Pulseaudio to my best knowledge does it all on the CPU, that's the audio equivalent of software rendering. Just like with window compositing, audio mixing should benefit a lot from being offloaded to a dedicated DSP, and I'm pretty sure there were cards capable of doing that at least 20 years ago. The whole Windows/Linux argument becomes much less clear if say Window is capable of HW offloading on cards that support it while Linux doesn't do that.

"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","Great post but your section about bit depth is a bit lacking.

>This has to do with how binary works.

It has nothing to do with binary, you can have irrational numbers in binary. It has to do with giving something infinite a finite value (integer) on a finite scale (representable by 16b). You might've already heard the fancy word for that: Quantization.

The issue with that is of course that you can't represent 16.000001% amplitude (Volume in dB) on an integer scale from 0 to 65535, so you have to round.  
This obviously alters the audio, not by much but it does. These alterations manifest in sound waves that shouldn't be there aka. noise.  
Since this is caused by the quantization, it's called *quantization noise*.

If a sound is drowned by noise you obviously can't (properly) hear it, so the distance between the (effectively) quietest and loudest sound (Fancy word: Dynamic range) is shrunk by the amount of noise there is.   
With 16b, the dynamic range is 96dB and if you drown the quantization noise with more noise that is harder for us to perceive (Fancy word: Dithering) the dynamic range can be perceived as ~120dB.

You do not want 120dB on your ears, that is pretty close to the *upper limit of pain tolerance* for a human.   
96dB is lower than that of course but not particularly pleasant either.

At reasonable listening levels (which you should honor as much as possible, hearing damage is *irreversible*), you cannot hear the noise caused by quantizing to 16b.",18,linux,Atemu12,

>The bit rate of an encoder means how much the audio will be compressed. PCM compression is super complicated, but it generally involves discarding silence, cutting off frequencies you cannot hear, and so forth. Radio encoding has a bit rate of roughly 128 Kbps, while most CDs have a bit rate of 256Kbps.

Bitrate should be in bits, you don't need to divide it by 8 to get bytes. The usual 192Kbps or 256Kbps naming is in bits, not in bytes. Saying that CDs are 256Kbps is really misleading.

In case anybody's looking for the manual, here's what I've compiled from the `pulse-daemon.conf(5)` man page and from the [libsamplerate API documentation](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/api_misc.html):


* The  method  `trivial`  is the most basic algorithm implemented. If you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the  other  hand it  has  the  worst  quality  of them all.
* The Speex resamplers take an integer quality setting in the range 0..10 (bad...good). They exist  in two flavours: `fixed` and `float`. The former uses fixed point numbers, the latter relies on floating point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the float point  resampler  is  a  lot faster, and it also offers slightly better quality.

    From the [speex documentation](https://www.speex.org/docs/manual/speex-manual/node7.html#SECTION00760000000000000000): Using a higher quality setting means less noise/aliasing, a higher complexity and a higher latency. Usually, a quality of 3 is acceptable for most desktop uses and quality 10 is mostly recommended for pro audio work. Quality 0 usually has a decent sound (certainly better than using linear interpolation resampling), but artifacts may be heard.

* The `soxr`-family methods are  based  on  `libsoxr`,  a  resampler library  from  the SoX sound processing utility. The `mq` variant has the best performance of the three. The `hq` is more expensive and,  according to  SoX developers, is considered the best choice for audio of up to 16 bits per sample. The `vhq` variant has more precision than `hq` and is more suitable for larger samples. The Soxr resamplers generally offer better quality at less CPU compared to other resamplers, such  as  speex.  The downside  is  that they can add a significant delay to the output (usually up to around 20 ms, in rare cases more).

* Algorithms provided by the `libsamplerate` library:
    * `src-sinc-best-quality` - This is a bandlimited interpolator derived from the mathematical sinc function and this is the highest quality sinc based converter, providing a worst case Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 97 decibels (dB) at a bandwidth of 97%.
    * `src-sinc-medium-quality` - This is another bandlimited interpolator much like the previous one. It has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 90%. The speed of the conversion is much faster than the previous one.
    * `src-sinc-fastest` - This is the fastest bandlimited interpolator and has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 80%.
    * `src-zero-order-hold` - A Zero Order Hold converter (interpolated value is equal to the last value). The quality is poor but the conversion speed is blindlingly fast.
    * `src-linear` - A linear converter. Again the quality is poor, but the conversion speed is blindingly fast.

I do not really agree with your proposition that ""lossless sounds better than lossy"" is ""blatantly untrue."" Blatantly? Really? When comparing FLAC to MP3 I think the jury is still out on that. It might be true but various studies that I have read in recent years suggest that for certain kinds of music there is a small, detectable difference  between the two for some listeners. I don't have time to go back and find those studies or I would cite them. This is a hot-button topic over on r/headphones and gets debated, sometimes with lots of anger, on and off. It is not easy to test that hypothesis with blind samples (I have tried it myself using college students ... and ended up concluding that my tests were flawed). I think that is why the jury is still out.

I have frequently coded and stored WAV format in Python and although the sample rate is two to the power of 16 as you suggest, it is signed, so the range recorded is not between 0 and 65535 but -32767 and 32767 (which has no practical bearing on the argument).

And when we justify the 44.1 kHz standard for WAV format (or CDs), we don't have to end up saying that the human ear can hear up to 20 kHz. It is very unlikely that humans can hear anything past 15 kHz. So, why, given the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, was the standard set at 44.1kHz? Because SONY, who set the standard, already had a lot of testing equipment and designs for  more testing equipment in their labs and on their books and the decision saved them a lot of money.

You do not necessarily need to buy an external DAC or amplifier. If you have a good motherboard with a decent Realtek audio chip, the solid state DAC on that chip is perfectly adequate for converting a digital file to an analog stream. The technology of DAC conversion is ancient and undemanding and, these days, trivial to code into solid state devices.

Analog out has to have adequate voltage to power your headphones, but again, a good motherboard will satisfy this requirement no matter what headphones you are using.

1. Nyquist assumes that the Y-axis is continuous, not discrete, as is the case with PCM audio. Because of that, the bit depth you choose actually effects the maximum frequency you can reproduce at a given sample rate. 

2. Related to #1, 16 bits per sample cannot actually reproduce audio with the range of human hearing without noticeable artifacts, especially in quiet passages of music; to correct for this, better 16-bit productions use dithering, where white noise is actually added into the mix that removes the quantization errors. You're effectively replacing a kind of error that human ears are sensitive to with one that they're better at filtering out. In either case, this was sensible in the 1980s and 1990s when storage space was more expensive than it is nowadays. At 24 bits per sample, the need for dithering goes awayl.

This is blatantly untrue, lossless audio formats were created for perservation and archival reasons. When you encode a lossy file from a lossless source, and you make sure that it's a 48kHz, 16-bit PCM encoding, you will not lose any important information. What is enough depends on the quality of the encoder. For OggVorbis, 192kbps is sufficient, for MP3, 256kbps should be preferred. 320kbps is excessive and the highest quality supported by MP3. In general, 256kbps does the trick, but with storage being abundant these days, you can play it safe and use 320kbps if it makes you feel better.

Untrue. If you're livestreaming, using a fixed bitrate is very valuable. Audio quality taking a hit is far preferable to dropping viewers because their pipes couldn't keep up with a bump.

Here's what no-one seemed to mention about Dmix back then: dmix is implemented in the ALSA library. That means it only works if everything goes through ALSA, and everything runs as the same user. Trying to play sound as another user won't work. If something grabs /dev/dsp, then things also won't work.

"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","Reference level is 105dB for full-range speakers, and 115dB peak for an LFE channel. This is intended to play sounds at 85dB, but leaving room for peaks in the track. For example, an audience clapping could cause enough soundwaves to be constructive at one point in time to reach 105dB of pressure (or more, but 105dB is the line in the sand so-to-speak), but still average <85dB. This is not damaging to hearing (in normal circumstances), but a speaker system (and therefore the PCM format) must be able to reproduce this to get the correct sound. Even if the speaker/amplifiers can't reproduce the 105dB peaks because of system limitations, by turning the volume up such that the 85dB average is still attained, the issue still exists.

115-96=19dB from an LFE channel and 9db for normal channels. this is audible in a quiet room, even though it's above the room's noise floor (which might be 10-20dB) because noise does still add (9dB+15dB=16dB). In a quiet piece of music, or the silence between tracks, this will be audible at 16bit at reference levels in a quiet room.

Most people dont listen in these conditions most of the time, but I dont think it's unreasonable to expect that this situation should be a baseline for noise performance, because it is quite easily attainable by most people. That's why I've always suggested 24bit audio where possible.

I haven't touched on dithering though, and that's because I dont have any experience with it; so I have a question: Does most hardware/software dither with decent quality? For example, AVRs (most of which are digital), pulseaudio, ALSA? Also, I use 100% volume digital signals to an AVR, where I adjust my volume (in the digital domain) before it goes to power-amps. My educated guess would be that pulseaudio isn't in a position to use it's own dithering algorithm, and so it's completely relying on the AVR to dither. Is that correct? Would an average AVR playing 16bit still have a -96dB floor for 16bit signals?",1,linux,zmaile,
"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","Resampling (upsampling or downsampling) a signal can be done perfectly *IF*:

* The sample rates are all > 2x the highest frequency contained in the signal ([Nyquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem))
* You have the whole signal

However, the waveform that you get will usually not (exactly) match your intuition, because the signal that you're starting with (44.1KHz sample rate or whatever) isn't the original signal, it's samples taken from the original - and the original's peaks and dips probably don't align exactly with the samples, but they're there.

The higher your sample rate, the less math you have to do to get close to the original, i.e. you can have a simpler DAC.  The lower your sample rate, the more tricks you need to use, like using Sinc functions or windowed FFT upsampling...

That's a strong assertion.  In my experience that's not the case since it happens on a variety of hardware (3 different setups) and a variety of configurations (literally 1000's).  IMO, it is often a problem caused due to latency induced from multiplexing.  The skips/stutters that I'm talking about are the inverse of latency (the skips occur because one hits the max latency boundary).  Even with a ""max latency"" of 200ms, I get skips/stutters with PA on certain sources (direct from CD source, bluetooth A2DP, ...).   You can see the effect of this, by doing a parec and noting 20ms-40ms of flat-0 wav output (probably a dozen per hour and definitely noticeable).

And that in itself is already horrible. Why in the hell is bypassing mixing even an option? If your system crucially depends on every app adhering to the Right Way of doing things, it's going to break whenever you bring up some random ancient app ported from another Unix, or some closed source thing.

99% of applications shouldn't need to know anything about audio configuration or what is the right device to play stuff into. There should be a sane default that just works, and any deviations from that should be intentional, manual, harder to do than just going with the default, and only needed for special circumstances (like eg, audio editors that might need to handle a variety of devices and have an actual reason to care about what input or output is being used for what purpose)

PulseAudio was trying to solve mixing, but at the time other mixing solutions existed and ALSA could also do it. That's probably not relevant to a factual post, but it is relevant to why PulseAudio wasn't instantly accepted by the user base.

PulseAudio is still in development and does still push broken releases. A recent release on Gentoo needed it's default compile flags changed so it didn't grab GB's of memory to itself. I've not heard of that kind of problem with ALSA for a long long time.

The Linux audio drivers have generally excellent support and are well written, it's usually the soundcard / chip combo producers that cause the problems with 38 slightly different versions of the same chip, all of which require careful tweaks. 99% of the time those tweaks now work out of the box, in very rare circumstances you may need to add kernel boot or module load options to correctly configure the driver. That's not ALSA's fault. That's the kernel drivers.

If you go looking somewhere like the Steam forums you will see many current issues getting games working well with PulseAudio, and virtually none of those problems will be traced back to ALSA being the problem.

Pulse does do a lot more than it needs to, and a lot more than your list. It tries to define default sinks, adjusts your available hardware input / output options depending on if you dare to plug an audio jack in, attempts to ""cork"" streams when it thinks it needs to (and it isn't always right about it), and generally reduces the capability of most soundcards that ALSA exposes. Want to use your speakers while your headphones are plugged in? ALSA says OK! .. Pulse says NO!

ALSA never failed me, the worst I experienced was some odd issues with a handful of steam games that came down to said complex asound.conf rather than ALSA itself.

Uh...what? Pulseaudio was created to ""solve mixing""? TIL...

I used ALSA's mixing well before Pulseaudio. Software mixing was not problem for the Linux desktop (it took a while for distros to enable it by default, but that's it). It's not the reason why Pulseaudio was created (ALSA's dmix works pretty well), and it's not the reason why Pulseaudio was adopted.

Let me quote the original Pulseaudio (polypaudio back then) 0.1 announcement:

>polypaudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement for the Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound or esd). In addition to the features esound provides, polypaudio has an extensible plugin architecture, support for more than one sink per source, better low-latency behavior, the ability to be embedded into other software, a completely asynchronous C API, a simple command line interface for reconfiguring the daemon while running, flexible and implicit sample type conversion and resampling, and a ""Zero-Copy"" architecture.


Also:
> That's not ALSA's fault. That's the kernel drivers.

Linux sound drivers have historically been and still are considered part of ALSA, period. Even if they are shipped with the Linux kernel today, the developers consider it ""ALSA"" and even named them that way: http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0810.1/2919.html",21,linux,EnUnLugarDeLaMancha,
"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","Fair enough, there are definitely issues in regards to how audio is piped around in PulseAudio, we can agree on that.

You raise a good point, my original argument was more that if sound in general is broken, it's usually driver related (the real culprit most of the time!). When it comes to actually playing audio back correctly, that is.

When it comes to piping information around, you are right that Pulse is usually the culprit. I might amend the article and go a bit more into detail where you should look for X kind of problem. Knowing what each component does helps you know where to look first.",6,linux,,

Doesn't seem like anything of concern. If the path goes Applications -> Pulseaudio -> ALSA, then as far as ALSA is concerned there would be only one input, and mixing one audio source is a no-op.

If to that you add ""libalsa app -> ALSA"", then now ALSA has two inputs, and mixing is exactly what is desired.

> Why do you care if mixing happens in a shared library or a process? different versions of libalsa work fine with each other. 64bit / 32bit .. It's never been a problem.

Processes can be monitored, scheduled, debugged, straced, and so on.

**edit:** processes are also great for privilege separation

**edit2:** and, processes can be ported, which means a pulseaudio using app can be made run on Windows by porting the daemon there (in fact that works). ALSA on the other hand makes no sense on Windows or anywhere else other than Linux.


Plus, there are other advantages. For instance, pulseaudio will accept connections in the absence of audio hardware, then start playing whenever a bluetooth or USB audio device appears, and can accept network connections.

> Originally you argue that ALSA shouldn't allow mixing to be avoided. Now you argue that it's fine that PulseAudio can avoid it.

No, it's very simple. Like this:

1. All audio should be input into the mixer. All. No questions.
2. Whenever the mixer has only one audio input, it doesn't need to mix anything. Therefore there should be no extra latency for a pulseaudio -> dmix chain where ALSA only has a pulseaudio client. Because in the 21st century we have the awesome power of the ""if"" statement and can automatically optimize for the special case of having a single audio source.

mix_audio yes

Is the default. That's what ALSA does by default. You don't even need the setting to be fiddled with. You don't need to turn it on. You probably didn't need to be messing with dmix settings at all.

It's not a simple ""IF"" statement it's an either / or situation.

If PulseAudio has grabbed the ALSA device for exclusive use, then mixing for other applications at ALSA level cannot happen. PulseAudio has exclusive use. Jack and PulseAudio do take exclusive use because it avoids additional latency and gives them full control of the device.

If PulseAudio (or any other application) hasn't got exclusive use, then ALSA mixing is the default with no need to fiddle with any settings.

You cannot do both of those things at the same time. (Well actually you can if you force PulseAudio to use ALSA dmix, but as I said, that adds additional latency and will probably need some messing around at both the PulseAudio and ALSA levels so you don't get glitches in playback because PulseAudio assumes it has exclusive use).

An ""IF"" statement doesn't work here. By default and design, PulseAudio blocks any other app from being able to use mixing through ALSA. It seems very simple to you because you don't really understand what's going on.

> Should anybody be able to block the audio system, for instance?

PulseAudio does exactly that. It blocks the ALSA audio system.

Multiple users for the same soundcard is a bizarre requirement. How many times do you have 2 people logged in to the same computer both wanting to play audio on the same soundcard at the same time? You can stop users having access to audio already usually by removing them from the ""audio"" group.

"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","Guess you got a Quantum? The advantage of RME (e.g., Fireface UFX) is integrated mixer/EQ functionality at low latency. From what I understand, the Presonus will require CPU mixing on the host machine, which limits the number of channels that can be mixed in realtime.",1,linux,xcvbsdfgwert,
"A complete guide of and debunking of audio on Linux, ALSA and Pulse","> You cannot do both of those things at the same time. (Well actually you can if you force PulseAudio to use ALSA dmix, but as I said, that adds additional latency and will probably need some messing around at both the PulseAudio and ALSA levels so you don't get glitches in playback because PulseAudio assumes it has exclusive use).

Here's how I see it. Exclusive access shouldn't be a thing. Latency should be low while ALSA only has one user (eg, pulseaudio). Whenever a second user of ALSA appears, mixing would begin, and latency would increase.

So in a running system, latency would increase the moment you used aplay, and would decrease again the moment it'd stop running.

> An ""IF"" statement doesn't work here. By default and design, PulseAudio blocks any other app from being able to use mixing through ALSA. It seems very simple to you because you don't really understand what's going on.

It works if you change the design of the system. I get ALSA allows exclusive access. I think it shouldn't be possible by design.


> Multiple users for the same soundcard is a bizarre requirement. How many times do you have 2 people logged in to the same computer both wanting to play audio on the same soundcard at the same time?

Why yes, there can be more than one session on a computer at once. I can lock my session, allow somebody else to log into their session, and return to it later. 

> If you didn't have PulseAudio, you wouldn't need to sandbox it, and once again, ALSA is still there! PulseAudio does not replace ALSA, it uses it for audio.

Here's what I mean. Having a sound daemon allows abstracting and compartmentalizing access. If I have pulseaudio, I can sandbox pulseaudio and be done. If every app talks to the sound devices on its own, then I need to apply sandbox to apps A, B, C, D...",1,linux,dale_glass,

So using Linux as a graphic designer means running Adobe CC in a Windows VM all day or trying to get Adobe CC to work in Wine (so far only managed to get Photoshop working, not Illustrator or InDesign.

In Linux currently you can only check a single futex at a time. In games you're potentially waiting on multiple different locks all at the same time and don't care which one is ready or frequently what order they are ready in.

In Windows apparently you can just say ""go check all of these"". 

In Linux that either has to be done serially or with the code weavers esync patch that actually leverages file handles in the place of futexes.

Edit: Due to a reply below about MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS being 64 or something I'm just adding this edit. 

I am correct. Maximum_wait_objects is an MSDN/NT kernel value and not a Linux kernel value.

Linux allows for as many futexes as you want with no maximum however FUTEX_WAIT takes a single futex object not an array. 

This patch (once cleaned up) could be very interesting as I stated it allows for waiting on groups and returning as soon as any of them are ready.

My journey with window managers (aka WMs),"I have also used many WMs, starting with Fluxbox, then through Openbox, xmonad, stumpwm, awesome, ion, herbstluftwm and i3. Maybe others I am forgetting. Many were interesting or very good in particular ways. Such as herbstluftwm's being nothing but a bash script, which is certainly simple and easy to work with. But, they usually end up wanting something key or making some simple daily task harder to do and so don't last for me. I did very much like i3-gaps and polybar and used it for quite a long time. It is very configurable and relatively easy to work with, all things considered, but still gives a modern slick looking desktop. Most tiling WMs look ugly, but i3 and polybar actually look good which is nice.

But, without fail, I always come back to Openbox and tint2. It is easily the best combination of lean and full featured I have ever used. I have yet to find myself disappointed that something necessary was missing. The configurations, as mentioned above, are a little less elegant being xml, but they are definitely simple and direct. And the theming is just beyond any other WM for customizing. Creating an entirely new custom theme is simply stupidly easy with just a single text rc file and some xpm images for buttons. And tint2 is very similar, with just crazy levels of customization available and the ability to add various buttons. Together these two tools are simply so configurable and powerful that I can actually make different setups feel like entirely different window managers which sort of reduces any desire to hop to others. Instead I just hop within Openbox by creating new themes, layouts and looks giving me something entirely new while still being just as solid under the hood.

At the time, Debian made it *very* easy to switch window managers. All the WMs with menu support would have all the other WMs offered through their menus, so you could switch on the fly without logging out. So I tried a whole bunch during this period. Afterstep, Windowmaker, flwm, ctwm, icewm, blackbox/fluxbox, enlightenment, gnome v1 & 2, kde v1 & 2, and more. But I mostly stuck with nice, simple, tiny fvwm.

Eventually I succumbed to the lure of full DEs instead of mere WMs, and I tried most of them. Bounced around for a while, but eventually ended up at nice, simple, tiny xfce, which is where I am now.

Extremely configurable, and adapts to my kinks. Using mouse/touchpad gestures instead of standard window buttons or standard snap-to-edge for window positions, much more to my liking.

Drag-to-edge is instead used for ghetto tiling. For example, drag-to-top is master left, tiled vertically on the right, divide is where the pointer was. 

When dragged from a button rather than the titlebar, some manipulation happens after a move: If the pointer was over otherwise empty space, the moved window fills it. If it was over another window, they swap positions. Sounds weird, works great for me.

Sometimes I use a preconfigured stacking layout with ovelap, automatic raising, and the least recent used things in one stack. Sort of how I'd work on a physical desk.

I think I moved to Fluxbox w/ Tint next... and then chanced upon dwm maybe 6-7 years ago I think. At that point of time, I was using a Eee PC and was actively trying to avoid using a mouse. That started my interest in tiling WMs, and since then, I've tried awesome, xmonad (when I wanted to learn Haskell, which never really happened), i3.

For the last 3 years or so, I've been mostly using i3 and I've gotten quite used to it -- really enjoy being able to split and change layout for a group of windows. I usually run Emacs as a daemon and open up lots of frames for various files / programs. Being able to manipulate them entirely with the keyboard is something I can't live without now.

A few months ago, I've also started to use Sway when I'm running on Wayland.

My journey with window managers (aka WMs),"I suffered from both the distro-hopping and wm-hopping illness :P My systems changed so much for the first 2 years of using Linux I basically didn't even bother trying to script or setup sustainable installs.

My path through window managers was similar to yours, with the order changed. I started on Gnome2 because thats what Ubuntu used (7.04 Feisty Fawn baby), but moved to Fluxbox. After that I tried just about every wm under the sun often only for days at a time (except strangely openbox), then I found i3. Used i3 for a few weeks but then I found Openbox... and thats where I stopped for about 8 years. Openbox+xfce4-panel and mostly XFCE apps. Recently decided to give wayland a shot and decided Sway was the only option for me (Gnome 3 isn't really for me); given that I didn't have other options/distractions, I actually worked to make Sway usable as a main and finally after a few months I find it as productive for me as my Openbox setup was. Now 6 months into Sway, I am easily better off with Sway than I was with Openbox.

If you decide to go Sway, really drop yourself into a trial by fire and commit to it. For me, focusing on the following really helped:

- Treat workspaces sort of like a taskbar e.g. workspace 1 is labeled ""Web"" and assign is used to auto-spawn web browser or web-related stuff there, workspace 2 is ""editors,"" workspace 3 is ""vids,"" etc. Between labeling the workspaces by topic and assigning opened apps to a given workspace, you avoid clutter and keep a logical flow. With Openbox I only started using other workspaces when the first workspace became cluttered with too much open stuff.

- Waybar. Applets are pretty configurable generally allowing scroll-up, scroll-down, and left/right/middle click actions- this makes mouse use quite convenient which is where tilers usually struggle. Waybar can use custom applets to do basically whatever you want, and has been very stable for me.

- Most tiler users focus on keyboard only, and thats fine; I however generally have two modes: mouse only and keyboard only. Basically, creation and consumption mode. I use a Logitech G602 mouse with the top 3 side buttons mapped to Ctrl/Mod/Alt. With this I can bind many actions via Sway's config. I can entirely using the mouse: change window split direction, close, fullscreen, float, open a custom termite/fzf launcher ""menu,"" scroll through open workspaces, move windows, etc. My ""menu"" also allows me to open specific workspaces that aren't open yet. Most people don't need this option, but I do.

Anyways, if you like i3 I do recommend giving Sway a shot- its pretty nice. I still use Openbox and XFCE on a few other computers around the house (mainly those used by family that aren't nerdy like me :P )- they prefer the more conventional approach to window management and thats fine.

The default behavior on all tiling window managers is to open the first window full screen, and when a second is opened, split vertically. You're trying to tell me manually dragging windows around to snap points is more efficient than doing literally nothing.

>I use another workspace and move back and forth as needed between them.  And this is, honestly, something *done more easily, flexibly and  powerfully on a traditional floating WM*.

WTF did I just read? How? It's either identical, e.g a keyboard shortcut to switch to a different workspace, and to move a window to a specific workspace. Or tiling is more flexible by using tags (dwm and awesome do this) instead of workspaces.

>usually much more complicated and awkward

In dwm (and a lot of others) resizing/moving a floating window is dragging the mouse with the alt key held down. Oh did I mention you don't have to aim at the titlebar/window borders to do this?

>more intuitive keybindings

Yes, I can see what you mean, but in practice it doesn't really work out that way. I can open one window in any manager and not really pay any noticeable price in efficiency. I set reasonable defaults on the programs I use so that they open in a size I can work with. And, if I open something that needs to be bigger I can use a keyboard shortcut to maximize. And, though that seems a loss in efficiency it is really down to muscle memory and one occasional keypress that is very automatic. But if I need to use an app that doesn't like tiling, or if I do want to use several windows, I have to work around the wm peculiarities which, for me, is more obstructive and problematic. It really is just down to how I fall into rhythms, and not a judgment of how others do things though.

Complicated may be the wrong word, but for me it generally comes down to more trouble. I don't work with floating windows much on a tiling setup, which of course is the point, and so when I do it is not something which is as natural to my muscles. I usually have to futz about to get it right. Not a big deal, and really not a thing at all on its own, but it just makes the process a bit clumsy for me and so I find it more natural on a floating setup.

>Can you give an example of what exactly you mean by that?

Oh boy, that will be tough for me as I didn't reinstall i3 when I did my last upgrade and so I don't remember the specifics as well as I would like. But, my recollection was of having to work around the large number of keybindings that are used by the window manager. Because of the emphasis on key bindings many are used in basic commands, resizing etc, and so a lot that I had become very used to in the past were not available. It always caused me some hiccups by forcing me to create different slightly more complicated keybindings for some tasks and then getting them mixed up as I would go along. I would give examples specifically but it really has been a while.

But, again, don't take what I wrote above as a criticism. I understand why tiling window managers are so popular, and have used them often in the past for decent periods of time. It is just that, in my case, I never seem to get to the point of really grokking it so that it becomes automatic. And so, while the most very basic actions were definitely a very tiny bit more efficient, anything with any complexity became massively inefficient. I have no doubt at all that for those who spend sufficient time, I usually make it six or seven months before drifting back to Openbox, it really does become more efficient and automatic than floating window managers. I just never quite get that far, and so it never delivers the experience I would hope for when going in. But, it's just a personal thing.",1,linux,cothrige,
My journey with window managers (aka WMs),"I think I have given you the wrong impression. I wasn't trying to criticize tiling window managers.

And I know with enough effort I could do the same for tiling, but it just never seems as comfortable and so I don't get to that point.

I don't disagree that people who can invest long enough and really stay with such a window manager it would probably become more efficient than what you can do on a floating wm. It just doesn't result in enough benefits for me to be worth that work, and during that process it is more clumsy. I see it kind of like people who learn Dvorak keyboards.

With the advent of websites as applications, this has become much easier because we can just (usually) use a standards-compliant browser.

I should not _have_ to justify my choices. Using Linux is normal. Linux users are not ""weird"".

Organizations prioritize Windows support because they want to maximize the value of their work by reaching the widest audience possible. Sometimes they just don't _have_ any Linux users among their audience and I can accept that as the reason why Linux support didn't receive any attention.

Because I care about properly integrating my software into the system. And more generally, because I care about the clear separation of upstream and downstream. My contribution to keeping that ecosystem healthy is not to follow the Windows approach when publishing my software.

I do see a point of using SnAppPak-style mechanisms for closed-sourse software, because corporate interests etc. (""Let's ship it ASAP!""), and because it's often not maintainable by the community (e.g. recompilation for library soname bumps), so having the application bundle everything it needs is the simplest way.

> I'm saying to provide a flatpak so people can easily install his software until distros provide a system package or in case distros don't package it.

As long as the software can be built the regular way, sure, nothing speaks against adding an option for that.

Then again, I believe that software in an early stage like this should be considered slightly experimental and rather unstable, and the user should thus probably expect crashes and some amount of manual debugging. I'm not sure if users who don't know how to build software manually will feel comfortable with software in this stage.

> But the elite linux users don't care about ease of use or people who have no idea how to build from source, those people can go fuck themselves right?

No, but the ""elite linux users"" care about software not trying to outsmart distributions. And building from source is not black magick, unless upstream decides to make it so.

That being said (in the interest of keeping the distribution ecosystem sane), if I wanted to allow non-technical users to use my tool, I'd rather provide a distribution-specific package (personal deb archive, PPA, AUR, Copr (?), etc.) for the distribution *I* am using, i.e. start with a small scope/userbase before trying to go megalomaniac and take over the World by trying to cater to the users of all distributions. But that's probably a matter of taste.

> I prefer system packages too, but if there is no system package I rather install a flatpak/appimage/snap then build from source.

I prefer simply packaging it myself. But again, a matter of taste.

Snȯwflake: an addon by the Tor Project that lets you help censored users access the Tor network by just installing it!,"Thanks to a new Pluggable Transport called Snowflake you can now help censored users access the Tor network by just installing an addon. The way it works is pretty simple: censored users learn about a temporary proxy (a 'snowflake') from a broker (using domain fronting or other techniques) that they establish a connection with using WebRTC, the temporary proxy then transmits the requests to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network, the temporary proxy thus functions as a middle point between the censored user and the bridge <=> Tor network. The idea is that by getting a significantly large of ever changing and decaying temporary proxies it will be hard for a single censor to keep track and block all of them. As [David Fifield](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/thesis/#chap:snowflake) eloquently explains,

> Snowflake derives its blocking resistance from having a large number of proxies. A client may use a particular proxy for only seconds or minutes before switching to another. If the censor manages to block the IP address of one proxy, there is little harm, because many other temporary proxies are ready to take its place. 

As explained earlier, when you function as a snowflake proxy **no exit traffic is generated at your level, you just transit traffic to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network. Hence there is no need to worry about which websites the clients are accessing through your proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours.** In addition Snowflake's strength comes from having a large pool of temporary proxies, so don't forget to spread the word and have a maximum of people installing this addon!

---------

The addon is available for Firefox on AMO:

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/torproject-snowflake/

And if you happen to want to install it on a Chromium based browser it is available as well on the Chrome Addon Store:

* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie

(You can find the links on the official snowflake website: https://snowflake.torproject.org/ )

--------

A couple of notes:

* You need WebRTC to be enabled in your browser for this to work, this is simply owing to how Snowflake works. The extension will display a warning if it detects that WebRTC isn't enabled.

* The addon tells you when a client is connecting using your proxy and how many clients you have helped circumvent censorship in the last 24h. However, right now Snowflake is only available for the **alpha** releases of the Tor Browser and then only for Linux and Mac OS, as such [there aren't currently many Snowflake users](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-transport.html?transport=snowflake), so it shouldn't be surprising for you to pass an entire 24h without having any reported client connection.

* There are other ways to run a Snowflake proxy that are outlined [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake#HowtorunaSnowflakeproxy).

The client layers encryption for each hop. You can only strip security for the layer intended for you, not the next hops because you don't have their private keys.

The client decides which relays are part of the circuit and since you don't have their private keys you can't spoof being them.

> The user cant resolve these hosts or validate i havent done a dodgy?

The tor client got a hardcoded list of directory authorities and their public keys. Those authorities sign the consensus listing all relays and their public keys. Without breaking this chain of trust you can't spoof or decrypt data intended for another relay.

That should stop speech dispatcher from starting. You most likely won't miss it. I think it's used to have Firefox read text from Web pages to you. Most people don't need that (though there are those that do, so it would be nice if the bug were fixed).",0,linux,CFWhitman,

It's not guaranteed that you'll be hit by it, but you could and then you get stuck buying a USB.

&#x200B;

I have a Ryzen and had static/buzzing problems, but I don't think it has anything to do with the chipset in my case. I think it's due to a bad grounding from my PC's power supply as it impacts external monitor speakers when they are not hooked up to the audio output.  Unless the problem is happening over USB...

&#x200B;

My solution to eliminate the fuzz for top quality 2-speaker setup...

* 2 JBL LC305 self-powered studio monitors.
* Lexicon Alpha USB-attached '2-channel recording studio'.
* TRS balanced connections

&#x200B;

So this way I get a pure digital connection to DAC outside of my case and away from the interference.  TRS balanced connections eliminate ground loop hums, and the LSR305 are decent honest studio monitors. Very flat sound, but  very positionally sensitive vertically.  Unlike most speaker types you actually need them tilted towards you.  Still need to get a sub to fill out the low-end, but they are great for everything else.

"Weekly Questions and Hardware Thread - July 10, 2019","Question about laptops

  


My boyfriend is getting into Web Development and has a little Acer Chromebook thats a few years old. The screen is pretty small, he's having some problems with the trackpad, and overall think he needs an upgrade especially since he'll be starting classes this fall.

I've done some research on laptops that work well with Linux, but I'd really like to ask you all what you would recommend.

The top three contenders I've seen are

Dell XPS 13

Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon

Librem 13/15

  


I'd like to make sure that when he installs Linux (if it's not the OEM OS) that everything works without a hitch (I've drivers and hardware can have minimal support).

  


Also, this is a surprise otherwise I'd ask him more, but based on the random remarks I've had with him I think those three laptops would be a good fit.

  


Any thoughts or other suggestions?

"Weekly Questions and Hardware Thread - July 10, 2019","Hello there. I've recently dipped my toes in the water by installing Pop!OS on an older machine of mine (i5-6500, Gigabyte Z170-HD3P, Sapphire RX580, 8GB DDR4-2800, SATA SSD) and it works fine OOTB.

&#x200B;

Now since i have a z-chipset motherboard, it's possible for me to raise the Baseclock by raising the BCLK-value. This works really well when booting to Legacy or UEFI installations of Windows 10. The +25% i put in (3.2GHz -> 4.0GHz) uplift is rather conservative, since the chip handles like a champ without taking extra voltage or anything. I know it's stable, i stresstested it extensively (not just power on, hwmonitor, some youtube and power off again). In Windows.

&#x200B;

When i try to boot to Pop!OS, i always end up in the GRUB menu and after selecting a boot option i get an empty screen save for one underscore character in the top left. All system fans go to 100%.

&#x200B;

I realize this is a rather niche usecase (OCing a normally un-OCable cpu), but maybe by chance someone can point me in the right direction.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

system boots to windows 10 no problem on stock settings

system boots to Pop!OS no problem on stock settings

Why then? It explicitly mentions compile times and the only thing you get out of better compile times that I can think of is less stuttering for some applications.

The post also mentions correctness but that's something that could have been fixed in llvm and I seriously doubt the assessment that that would have been more  work.

"Steam for Linux :: Help us test ACO, a new Mesa shader compiler for AMD graphics!","I'm speaking purely on technical grounds (although there are social claims to be made too).

At the command-line level, LLVM is famous for having ""good errors"". But that can more accurately be summed up as ""errors that look pretty for people who don't know much about programming"". While that isn't a negative, it's not particular useful for experienced programmers (whereas GCC has always provided more *useful* information). LLVM's implementation also breaks in really annoying ways, and bugs have been left unfixed for several years.

At the ""external API"" level, LLVM's ""stable"" C API breaks in every single release. I think I implemented the very first bindings to Python (though nobody but me ever used them, I think), and it was exceedingly painful, especially since there are a lot of between-releases builds of LLVM out there, so you can't even add `if VERSION < '3.0'`s  to fix them!

At the ""internal API"" level, which includes the C++ external API, LLVM is even more of a mess, requiring complete rewrites of code between versions. This is a distribution *nightmare*. (I haven't personally used this, but it is extremely well documented)

GCC's plugin API, which has been around since 2010, is *allowed* to change, but in practice the changes are very easy to deal with (there are multiple projects out there, including mine, that can compile against *any* version of the plugin API, which includes crossing the C/C++ language transition!). The plugin API is far more complete than LLVM's C API, and parts of GCC not currently exposed to the plugin API (which is basically a ""nobody has needed it yet"" thing) tend to follow the same pattern.

The GCCJIT API is even more stable, and is dreamish to use. It is what the LLVM C API aspired to be.

Now, a brief mention of the social aspect:

The only reason people think LLVM is some great thing is because it has Apple/Google marketing behind it, and the reason corporations like it is because it allows proprietary code.

"Steam for Linux :: Help us test ACO, a new Mesa shader compiler for AMD graphics!","I'm only talking about the optimizations that are done by LLVM ""proper"", so stuff that's backend-specific like regalloc is excluded.

The biggest wins are:

Note that parts of the 3 E's are *implicit* in SSA.

TBH I consider constant folding too trivial to even count as a separate pass, unless reassoc is involved. Note that IEEE floats forbid reassoc.

Loop hoisting can be viewed as a potentially-complex variant of CSE.

Note that I'm not saying these should be the *only* optimizations implemented, just that they're the ones that will give 90% of the benefit for 10% of the work. Once these are implemented, the backend-specific logic (which LLVM's backend clearly doesn't have) will be more important. Note that regalloc may find it beneficial to undo CSE.

Yes, as mentioned, it is a selling point now.

Not having to wait five minutes (!) on a Ryzen 2700X for all Quake Champions shaders to compile is also quite nice, and even nicer for those on older quad-core CPUs. There are more use cases for fast compile times than just stuttering, although that's arguably the most noticeable one.

From what I've gathered, ""Fixing LLVM"" seems to be the tricky part. We ran into issues where one of the AMDGPU backend developers came to the conclusion that a proper fix would require changes to LLVM common code. That's not something you just push through in a couple of days.

There's also the whole issue with the LLVM relase cycles, two releases per year aren't great when they inevitably introduce regressions, which then require workarounds inside the Mesa drivers or just remain unaddressed for several months.

I don't know too much about GCC, but I would say LLVM/clang has a couple of things going for it that can't just be from ""marketing"":

1. It's trivial for beginners to get involved making significant changes to the compiler. [Writing a pass is extremely easy](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html) and the code is well-documented and organized. It's written in C++ which, for a compiler, makes the code much more readable and easily extended. Recently GCC has moved to C++.
2. One of the best selling points of LLVM/clang is that you can have the compiler emit a human-readable IR (or it compiled in bitcode form) which can be reused for any purpose by external tools supporting LLVM IR or even different compilers or different versions of LLVM/clang. In my work it's very helpful to see how a change I made to the compiler affects  intermediate code generation. GCC, to my knowledge, has made it difficult to get this info for purposes of avoiding the creation of non-GPL external tools.

I do wish LLVM/clang was under a GPL license, though. I disagree with their argument that people will eventually give back because it's difficult to maintain a fork. I work at a company large enough to maintain a fork for years and unfortunately they have almost no incentive to push their changes to upstream, which they would if LLVM/clang was GPL-licensed.",9,linux,Prince781,

I think your view of what are valuable optimizations are wildly inaccurate, especially for GPUs. These aren't going to give you anything close 90% of the benefit. There are a lot of performance cliffs on GPUs, so missing the right transform can do a lot of damage.

Sure, faster is better but realistically this takes a lot of time with both compilers and the improvement won't be in the orders of magnitude. Nice, yes. Noticeable improvement to the gaming experience… likely not.

> There are more use cases for fast compile times than just stuttering, although that's arguably the most noticeable one.

See, that's the part I have problems with. If the biggest gain is improving stuttering and the new compiler manages 50% faster compile times when mature you still have lots of stuttering. Again, nice to have but probably not really changing the experience with an empty cache.

> AMDVLK can kind of circumvent that problem because it comes with its own LLVM, Mesa doesn't.

That's a policy and not a code problem then. It is possible to link a mesa llvm fork statically into mesa.

Stuff that you clearly haven't heard about that has been pretty widely discussed alongside VXVK shader stuttering or even sometimes emulation? How much have you actually read into shader compilation and the optimisation of it before? You're not really meant to share precompiled LLVM shaders because the way they get written and compiled means that you might end up with shader code that simply won't run on another dGPU despite them both being ""DX11 class"" or the like. iirc Dolphin had a similar issue (ie. Shader compilation shits all over performance and caching only can ever prevent it from reoccurring) and solved it not with extra caching or the like, but by improving the actual compilation process to a point where it was unnoticeable. (ie. Kept to a background thread, game runs without whatever uncompiled shaders there are while building its cache up, share the half-way complete UID shader files so you can compile and import them before you play, etc)

> No offense but this is complete nonsense. It's a shader compiler. It compiles shaders. That's it's single feature.

Yes, and a tyre ""only"" keeps your car on the road, yet you have hundreds of varieties of tyres all suited to different uses despite this simple goal that they all have.

Just because it does one thing, doesn't mean it can't still be suited to a particular market that makes heavy usage of that thing and has specific requirements.

>bollocks. that has nothing to do with this.

Shader compilation has absolutely nothing to do with shader precaching? Right, because they're not intimately related to each other at all.

>not going to happen. it would need speedups in the ballpark of 100x.

Not if you can have pre-generated shader files, maybe shared via Steam. That is what I meant by preventing the problem entirely and could allow compilation to take up 10x longer CPU time as it does now and still have zero impact on the game.

r/linux Discusses: Web Browsers and You - How to protect yourself online and bring about a free and open web,"> Do someone know if one can achieve this on a Raspberry Pi?

I can think of several methods ...

The simplest is probably the use of an extension which redirects matching web requests to an url in your local network. This uses part of the [webRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeRequest) that will be disabled in Chrome with the removal of Manifest v2 compatibility, but it will continue to work in Firefox and possibly other Blink forks that keep to the old feature set. It's the very method Decentraleyes uses, the only difference is that the extension doesn't redirect to moz-extension:// but to some device in your local network, so you could take a look at that code and use most of it.

You can also use the Pi as a web proxy and use custom cache durations for certain matches. Take squid proxy for example, with the [refresh_pattern](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/refresh_pattern/) directive you can determine that a matching request should *always* be filled from the local cache and never be updated from the original source, even if that was explicitly requested.

Another potential idea would be to modify the name resolution of the most common CDN (sub) domains with the help of PiHole, changing the target to somewhere in your local network. A custom scripting solution on the target server could then do any number of things. For example, first check if the requested url path is cached locally, if yes then simply output that file. If not, then fetch the file from the real CDN server on the internet, optionally store it locally and then forward it to the browser that requested it.

Either method could run along with PiHole on the same device, but the PiHole's dashboard/web interface would need to be moved first if you want to work on a custom solution that doesn't require the proxy configuration on target devices.

Another problem with the MITM method is that you'd basically be assuming the identity of a remote server and since the majority of web requests nowadays are over HTTPS, you'd need to create certificates for those domain names. This isn't a topic I'm very experienced in, but you'd need to add a trusted root certificate to each device this method is intended to work on, or they won't trust your self-signed certificates.",3,linux,DanTheMan74,

When Google created Webkit by forking it from KHMTL (From KDE's Konqueror) it became insanely popular to do webkit-this and webkit-that.  You had a rapid development of all sorts of html libraries for almost every variety or languages and toolkits under the sun. QT versions, Java versions, Python versions, etc.

Well most of them went to shit and were not maintained very well. After a few years they became riddled with bugs and security issues.  WebkitGTK wasn't perfect, but it was better then the rest.  There was quite a lot of drama over this a few years ago as the Linux desktop landscape was full of exploitable bugs in virtually every email client or rss reader or anything else that needed to render modern html well.

&#x200B;

The problem with WebkitGTK, generally speaking, isn't with the library... per say.  The problem is that distribution maintainers do a bad job keeping up to date on things or make changes to it to make it fit distribution licensing policies (and other political stuff) that end up breaking things for other people.

WWW tech is rapidly changing and insanely complex.  The whole system built around javascript and various web standards is mind-boggling in it's complexity.  So bugs and fixes and security issues and changes in standards come in at a constant clip.  IT's extremely difficult to keep up.

&#x200B;

Trying to shoehorn something like web technology libraries into a six month release cycle or 'Long Term Support' model is a recipe for disaster.    Just trying to put a some library related to that into a some repo and have it sit there for 4 years without touching it as much as possible isn't going to work.  The technology isn't going to sit still long enough to make that work.  Lots of software technology works very well with LTS or annual release models, but HTML rendering libraries are not one of them.

Luckily with browsers and libraries like this most distributions have gotten a lot better.   For example Debian backports have gotten much easier to use so that people are not stuck with broken, outdated, and insecure software for years and years.  Which is what used to happen.",4,linux,natermer,

In a nutshell, I: 

i) Installed SuSE Linux onto a spare PC turning it into a Linux server. 

ii) Setup port forwarding on my home router so that users connecting to my external IP address on port 22 were forwarded to my Linux server

iii) Registered a free domain name, and pointed the A record to my routers external IP address.

iv) Built a simple website to advertise my Linux Shell Provider.

vi) Configured Jailed environments for each user account.

vii) Charged 1 UK Pound (or 1 US dollar) for each Shell Account.

We have some folks who create linux drivers for the device's special hardware, FPGA interaction and those things. Others maintain the OS.

My job involves writing custom kernel drivers for our hardware and maintaining customized Andoid and Debian systems.

You need to know how a linux based system works from power up to UI. Looking at something like linux from scratch is good to understand that.

It helps to know a bit at a high level about all the pieces and how they fit together but also be capable of deep diving into any specific area as the need arises.

You need to be comfortable reading code written by others, in at least C/C++/Python/Java (for Android at least). Build systems and scripts like Make / CMake etc too.

You will probably read far more code than you write. 80 to 90% of any system will be existing open source code, sometimes with a few customizations.

If you do driver work a basic understanding of digital electronics and how to read a schematic and use an oscilloscope is very useful too.

There are several types of linux based embedded systems today:

* Traditional embedded linux. Completely built from source. These days often uses buildroot or yocto. Necessary for small embedded systems running from <1G flash

* Classic Linux, eg Debian. If you have plenty of flash (like a 1G+ SD card) you can actually run Debian or some other distributions that support your processor architecture (which is more likely to be ARM than X86). This can be a much faster way of getting something running as it's mostly a question of kernel work, the majority of users pace is just selecting the packages you want then developing your application (which could well be in something like python).

--------------

So what *is* the problem you're having?  Well, there are two potential issues:

1. You've started swapping, or otherwise gotten hung up on an IO thing.  This one *is* a nasty condition under Linux (but also any other system).
2. The process that has broken and is hung is part of your graphics pipeline.  For example, it's issued some set of commands to X, and X is now stuck at 100% CPU use.  You can't use interrupts or priority to work around this and get a graphical interrupt... because the graphics are what's broken.  If you had your system set up to run a second graphical login, I would expect you could log into that one and have it work fine.

"Linux needs real-time CPU priority and a universal, always-available escape sequence for DEs and their user interfaces.","This isn't really a solution. It's a workaround (though perhaps it should be done anyway).

The problem (as far as I can tell) is that when linux runs low on memory it start's scrounging around for things to push out of memory. And it finds all the executable pages of these processes in the background that aren't currently being read. OpenSSH gone. You desktop environment, gone. The userspace of your video card driver, gone. 

These aren't even sent to swap, because these are unmodified pages from the executable on the disk, linux can just forget them and load them back in when they are actually needed.

When the memory gets low enough, and your actively executing code is deleted and then pulled back in at a rapid pace, your computer craws to a halt.

Because it craws to a halt due to execution I/O long before it actually runs out of memory. the Out of Memory killer never executes. And because it's executable pages, this can happen even swap is disabled.

**My proposed solution:** If a page is pushed out of memory (to swap, or a deleted executable page) and then pulled back in within a few seconds of execution time, the page should be marked as ""keep in memory"".

What is that they say? An anecdote is not data.

For Windows this is definitely a matter of version. I have seen Windows XP to 7 freeze completely without any means of gracefully saving it. Before that it would simply halt (I sometimes have bad dreams with that win95 error sound).

This goes for macOS too (I have only experienced this on OSX and Mojave). I maxed out its CPU with a simple `tail -f`, which apparently Spotlight was trying to index in the background. Since I was logging 24/7, it was not apparent that this was going on until it was too late. In one case it rebooted itself, in a different one it simply froze, and often the GUI has become sluggish. I was unable to kill anything. MacOS is not magic.

Neither of those systems provided me with a CTRL+Alt+F[0-9] option AFAIK to gracefully kill, shut down and/or deal with the issue.

However, I have noticed that my Fedora laptop sometimes freezes (T420s). As a long time Slackware user (Xfce+i3) where this never happened over the course of 10+ years, and from which one can always reach a TTY, I can only attribute it to GNOME and/or systemd, without any tangible evidence for either.

I really don't see the problem with switching to tty's to kill some program that hanged, it's way faster than hoping the the system UI/DE will magically work, and at least for me, its WAY more comfortable, I remember the first time I killed a hung process from tty when I had just switched to Linux last year, it was such revelation to learn that even if my DE was completely hung, the solution was just some key-presses away

The Unix design philosophy (and good system design in general) would encourage a module that provides  specific functionality to not handle problems external to its domain.

In this case, the kernel shouldn't need to handle starting a universal gui process manager, since GUIs and DEs are external to the kernel's domain. Doing so would make major assumptions about how the kernel is being used. 

The only reason something like Windows *could* make that assumption is because it comes with a single, built-in DE. (even then, I highly doubt that Windows handles CTRL-ALT-DEL at the kernel layer. It only makes sense to handle it within the DE). 

I believe the best solution would be standardization. Have the escape sequence handled in a generalized way by various DEs looking to be compliant and get them to agree with each other on what that escape sequence should be.[1] Similar to something like the XDG specification: the kernel doesn't enforce any rules requiring configuration files to be stored under `~/.config`, but it's (often) community consensus that that's where configuration files should go. 

Due the huge prevalence of CTRL-ALT-DEL as an escape sequence, I think it would be a great candidate for that kind of standard.

Gnome specific issue

[https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GnomeShell/GnomeShell4](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GnomeShell/GnomeShell4)

>GNOME Shell 3 was designed to be an X11 compositing  manager, meaning relied on X11 for a lot of heavy lifting, such as  interacting with GPUs and input devices. With this in mind, it has not  been crucial to allow low latency input handling and drawing, as when  low latency and high performance throughput has mattered, the X server  has been the one responsible. For example, input goes directly from the X  server to the X clients, and when high performance is really important  (e.g. fullscreen games), applications have had the ability to bypass  GNOME Shell and rely entirely on the X server for passing along content  from the client to the GPU. For visual feedback that also relies on low  latency, the X server has also been completely responsible, namely  pointer cursor movement.   
>  
>It  has also been possible to implement things related to input handling  (such as text input including input methods) using X11 and existing  implementations in things like GTK+.   
>  
>With  Wayland, this landscape has changed drastically. Now instead there is  no X server between clients and GNOME Shell, and no X server between  GNOME Shell and the GPU, meaning GNOME Shell itself must be able to  provide low latency forwarding input from input devices and low latency  forwarding output from clients to the GPU.

3. Take a guess at which one is the application that's frozen, hope that the process name makes it self evident. Which often isn't the case.
4. Another terminal command to kill the process (assuming the user remembers how to do this, probably won't unless they do this all the time).

If you have ever seen the “this app isn’t responding dialog”, its because of this. This is because for some reason in 2019 some devs still don’t understand the concept of using non-ui threads to heavy lifting or IO.

The biggest thing i hate is when buggy games enter both exclusive fullscreen and also set the topmost flag on their window. This makes alt-tab, super, ctrl+alt+del, and ctrl+shift+esc.... not work correctly. I guess windows isn’t smart enough to revoke the topmost flag when a window stops responding (it already kicks apps out of fullscreen quite well). Some apps also go out of their way to disable these hot keys, which is extremely annoying when they stop behaving. God forbid the user alt-tab to look at a game wiki, right?

As far as long running stuff goes, it is possible for the OS to throw a fit if you have a long running cuda/opencl/compute workload. however there are usually apis to signal that you expect your task to take a while, and that you are still aware that you are processing data and taking a while to do so. On an unrelated note, windows also provides power state change notifications and information to applications, so several years after the release of windows 10 there is no excuse for apps to lose data if windows reboots for an update. But i guess taking the time to use those apis is too much effort.

Anyways, a lot of these issues with apps not responding and the system locking up as a result are mitigated with more cores, more ram, and a ssd/NVMe drive. Can’t really hang on io when you have 1-5GB/s of throughput on most nvme drives and 10ish or more physical cores to work with.

It's not exactly rocket surgery to implement either, but it's certain to uncover a lot of bugs in applications that expect certain scheduler behavior and choke in strange ways when they're not seeing it. The more benign/simple applications would probably not notice anything happened at all though. It's also going to lead to problems with distributed applications/things with GUI front-ends to daemon processes and other oddballs like desktop virtualization applications and video games.

If you wanted to get really deep into it, you could start putting desktop processes into their own cgroups and have a sort of 'userspace hierarchical scheduler' ala kubelet that dynamically changed the I/O priorities and memory reservations and such based on focus/application request.

Memory limits in cgroups can be enforced in two ways:

- traditional OOM, which works fast since it is an arbitrated action and the kernel is not already scraping the bottom the barrel, however SIGKILL to a backend is a no-go as Postgres defensively resets the whole instance to prevent loose ends in the shared buffers.


- cause every process in the cgroup to receive no scheduling time until memory is freed. This is what I ended up using, but it's not straightforward as signal handlers for a clean termination are not scheduled either. I had to add a small ""balloon"" process to each group. What I do when saturation is reached is  SIGINT the Postgres child and then kill the balloon process to create some headroom & resume operations. Signals are asynchronous, so the handler is not 100% guaranteed to be the first thing to run once scheduling is resumed, but so far it never failed.

It's honestly come a long way. I admit a bias on my part as I've gotten far more competent and comfortable with linux as time goes on, but it is improving. There has been a recent push on the (g)UI/(g)UX side of things that's slowly paying dividends as well. Problem is those efforts are split on the various forks and flavors and implementations and thus a lot of time is spent reinventing - or at least reimplementing - the wheel for all the different Distros, DE's, WM's, DSP's, etc etc. As such, there is no central design/UX authority for linux as a whole. I don't really think there should be, and more importantly, don't see how there could be while still being linux as we know it. This is kind of a classic case of ""we have 14 different standards, we need to unify them all ... next thing we know we have 15 competing standards"" [insert relevant xkcd here].

For the longest time though, the GUI based environment in linux was frequently shunned, and those that did invest in it weren't doing so under a unified effort to deliver a singular UI/UX, to say nothing of their individual ability (or available time) to produce a high quality product. Those working on and in that space were more focused on adding new features here, and shiny new graphics there, and not on developing a clear, consistent style guide and implenting across the entire stack (DM, DE, WM, etc) to deliver not only on that visual aesthetic and style, but on a consistent and clear user *experience* as well. That has improved significantly recently, but the efforts are still fractured across this distro or that, or this DE or that. Again, consolidating all of that into one singular effort is never going to happen. The nature - and some would argue, the hole point - of linux and (F)OSS is to customize and experiment and innovate and make it your own, so even if someone were to lead such a charge, there would still be the other 9001 and different versions as well. 

So is it a messaging problem? Perhaps all these different distro's and their various flavors shouldn't be all marketed as a singular ""Linux OS experience."" Those of us in the linux community realize this internally, and yet there's still that ever repeated mantra of ""Year of the Linux Desktop."" Sure, those of us already drinking the koolaid recognize that means you can have all kinds of flavors and concoctions of said koolaid, but to everyone not already in the cool kids club, they read and perceive ""the linux desktop"" as a singular OS/experience. And it most certainly is not. And again, we don't see that as a problem, and yet, it's a significant hurdle/point of confusion for those outside the bubble.

"Linux needs real-time CPU priority and a universal, always-available escape sequence for DEs and their user interfaces.","Do I want to avoid accidental super key presses in the middle of competitive game, of course. As you said, most gamers want these features, however I want them to exist at the hardware level (dip switch or button on the corner of the keyboard). Most ""gaming"" keyboards support something like this, even my ""non-gaming"" ducky shine ii has little switches on the back (yes a pain to access) for super key toggling. However, games are also the buggiest things I run on my computer. I want full control of my system, and giving that up to something that will completely lock up my input because it decided to disable a few keys or set WM_TOPMOST (never do this, please) is frustrating. I get that game developers want to pretend and treat PCs as if they are consoles, but in reality I use my computer for much more and the ability to smoothly alt-tab to a browser, discord, spotify, etc, etc is important. Games which do things like setting WM_TOPMOST, games which do not yield mouse capture, games which try to take exclusive control over my audio devices (no music, podcasts, youtube videos, etc) which can be blocked (thankfully), and games which require me to reboot my system because I can't even open task manager to kill them are a nightmare. 

If the developer wants me to be fully immersed when playing the game, they should add a disclaimer at startup. I should never had to yield full control of my system to any application. I don't care what it is, what the reason is for, etc.

Warning: The rest of this is rant about random things, not exactly in reply. Feel free to skip it. TL;DR Wayland/UWP have the potential to be better and fix a lot of issues, but currently they don't.

Thankfully, most games have migrated away from these user/system hostile behaviors. Heck, most games also render to an intermediate render target, followed by an upscale to the back buffer to avoid mode switches (5-10 seconds of the monitors effectively power cycling) when entering and leaving exclusive full-screen. This costs a bit of GPU memory bandwidth, but most games have a comfortable amount of headroom so this isn't an issue, and it makes switching in and out of those games much more pleasant. Even so, most games have HDR pipelines these days so unless the monitor supports it, an HDR -> SDR render-pass is required before presenting the back buffer.

I don't mean to berate on games, I have seen my fair share of desktop apps just straight up acting weird, however I try to eliminate those from my workflow as much as possible and even so, having more physical cores on my system helps alleviate the performance impact. Aka, I can still browse the internet comfortably even if the OS is taking a while to kill something. Of course, whenever this happens on linux, a quick ""$mod+d, killall <problematic thing>, enter"" or ""$mod+shift+q"" has never failed me.

Not trying to say people do or do not want some of the features these apps provide, or that problems others experience are fake. I just believe that as long as the user has more comprehensive control over their system, things generally tend to be better. Part of the problem is that applications have a lot of control over the system, and conventional desktop operating systems do not give the users options to control this. The fact that things [Borderless Gaming!](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming) are possible is both an incredible testament to how powerful and flexible these APIs are, and just goes to show how much control random apps have over your system (manipulating other windows without their consent). Another example is the DS4 controller, steam and a few other services like to inject DLLs into games to ""automatically"" handle these types of controllers, so the game just seems them as an XInput controller. This is fine, because supporting DS4 requires extra support from the developer (using the deprecated and poorly documented DirectInput API which has lots of ""gotchas""). However, if a game goes out of their way to support DS4, and even supports features not exposed by XInput, this actually becomes a frustrating problem to workaround ( I can dig through reddit/twitter to back up this claim ).

Win32 and X11 are too powerful/flexible in my opinion, Wayland and UWP attempt to solve these concerns however I think they are both too limiting, while not giving enough control to the user. what we really need is strong and extensive permissions systems, similar to iOS. If the app wants to do something funky with my system, the OS better show a pop-up asking for my consent first. I also better have the ability to audit these things in a log of some kind. For example, take a password manager. Ideally, a password manager should be able to perform auto-typing, and it should be able to add and revoke things from the clipboard. In order to accomplish this it only needs the following permissions: fake user input for short time periods, submit text to the clipboard, and clear the _entire_ clipboard history (btw keepassxc auto-clear doesn't work on KDE because it always retains at least the latest clipboard entry). Note how reading the clipboard and intercepting user input globally are not required, and thus the user doesn't need to grant permissions for these things. This requires using a bunch of APIs which happen to overlap with the kinds of things malware and viruses would use. Newer protocols and APIs simply forbid these kinds of things as a result, which is why a whole class of (useful) applications are simply not possible under the constraints of Wayland and UWP. Earlier I mentioned iOS, which I think is a huge step in the right direction. Android may have changed since I last used it, but back when I did the model was still ""on by default, opt-out if you dig through the settings"". Opt-in is the way to go, and requiring apps work as advertised without permissions granted (how the app store works) is also nice. From what I understand, android has flipped their model, but google does not require apps to work without permissions (correct me if I am wrong). This doesn't extend well to the desktop though, which is why an audit system is important. I am also unsure how these permissions systems work from the development side of things. Ideally, developers shouldn't have to think about it. If they make an API call to access some obscure feature, the user should be prompted for the smallest scope of that feature (e.g. injecting user input but not intercepting it). If they reject it, an exception or error code should be returned for the developer to handle.

Unrelated side point: Applications should also respect my desire to resize them, not because I actually go about resizing windows often, but because with a tiling window manager, it is fairly common that a window will be resized beyond it's control, and they shouldn't try to force or constrain that. Seems to be less of a problem these days, again, maybe I just avoid problematic applications.

The Linux kernel is a massive toolbox of options, which is why it's able to run on anything from a toaster to a super computer, you just have to configure it the right way. You're in the mercy of the distro builders unless you change it yourself.

The reason for these memory issues is something called overcommit, which is basically that the kernel promises applications memory that just isn't available. If you've got 3GB of RAM available and an application asks for 4GB, the kernel will give the application 4GB, hoping that it won't really use that much of the allocated space, that more memory will be available in the future, or that the OOM_KILLER can find a soft target to kill to free more memory.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting  
http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/virtual_memory_settings_in_linux_-_the_problem_with_overcommit/

By default on desktop distros this value is set to `0`, but if you set it to `2` the kernel won't overcommit.

> so when this happens I get a prompt that asks me what to kill?

No, this generally isn't a thing in the Linux world. The kernel is the serious business rock on the bottom that works through text configurations issued by UID `0` aka root. You can configure it to behave in 1000s of different ways and is highly resilient to erros and problems.

Then on top you have the windowing system, the desktop environment and the graphical applications. This is like a clown car on top, honking along the highway in 40 Mph thinking it's top dog, while it's generally just badly written applications running 20 layers from the kernel. Having the kernel prompt the clown user for input on system behavior in real time just doesn't make any sense.

> I would most of the time chose Firefox but having a choice could be safer.

By default the kernel keeps a list of who's been naughty or nice at `/proc/<PID>/oom_score`, and you can manually set a higher value for Firefox by changing `/proc/<PID>/oom_score_adj`, but a better option is to use something like earlyoom and configure the behavior you'd like and add a list of the usual suspects that you'd like to be killed first:

For the record, I despise Microsoft. I consider them to be in the same league of evil as Facebook. However, I’m not going to pretend that KDE or Gnome are superior at something when they clearly are not.

The Linux desktop experience always has been, and is still to this day shit.

>Touch input is the new kid in the block concerning input events. It’s  a technology which was created after X11 got created and thus it is not  part of the X11 core protocol. On X11 this makes touch a weird beast.  E.g. there is always an emulation to a pointer event. Applications which  do not support touch can still be used as the touch events generate  pointer events. Now this is actually a huge sacrifice for the API and  means that touch feels – at least to me – as a second class citizen in  X11.

Here's what X has that wayland currently does not

* Desktop environment (""compositor"") agnostic remote control (VNC, TeamViewer, NX, CRD, etc...)

* Desktop environment (""compositor"") agnostic tablet support, assuming any compositors even can add it or do support it.

* Desktop environment (""compositor"") agnostic global input sniffing support ^†

* Color Management (this is in the works, but has yet to prove itself as a useful implementation - previous discussions had indicated that many core developers had no fucking clue what color management was, so I hear.)

I'm sure there is a lot more that's ""up to the compositor"", but I can't be bothered to go find out. Even if compositors and toolkits implement these missing functionalities (so much for keeping it simple, right?), that's not to say that they will be compatible with each other. This is more or less just an attempt to carve borders in the Linux community, something that - incidentally - the GNOME camp (a group of people who appear to overlap with the wayland development/hype team) would seem to desire.

GTK supports drag and drop.

>if GTK is the best choice for the UI,

It's a choice.  Nothing is best.

Toolkits are relatively unimportant in the long run. People make a big deal of them but more importantly is the tools, the stability of the project, and the ecosystem surrounding them.

GTK a massive C project from the 1990s that has layers of object oriented framework built into it.  It's not everybody's cup of tea.  The advantage of C is that everything else is written in C... C++, python, etc.  So libraries written in C can be made to support almost any language you want.

Basically:

If you want to make something that integrates into Gnome: use GTK and related products.

If you want to make something that integrates into KDE: Use QT and related products.

If you want to make cross platform...

Either don't bother and just separate the logic of the application from the UI and write multiple front-ends for it. This will get the best 'native' results.

or

Use something like Electron or just go Web.  For your project I would just use electron.

>what is systemd,

Systemd can be different things, depending on context.

Systemd is a project to unify the low-level 'plumbing' of Linux operating systems.  They provide a variety of daemons, utility, tools, libraries and documentation that Linux distribution maintainers use to built the 'bare bones' of their operating systems.

Systemd is also the software suite that Systemd project produces.

Systemd is the main init daemon that the rest of the software suite revolves around.

&#x200B;

The INIT system is the first userland process that gets loaded into memory and executed by the Linux kernel during bootup.  It's job is to prepare the file systems and initialize the rest of the userland.

The basic boot setup for Linux on x86 machines is something like this:

1. Hardware gets voltage,  firmware POSTS.
2. BIOS/UEFI and other low-level firmware gets executed.
3. BIOS/UEFI initializes the storage, loads and executes the boot loader, typically grub as per their specifications.
4. Grub stage 1 reads the file system and loads and executes stage 2.
5. Stage 2 grub reads the configuration file on the file system and based on this loads the Linux kernel and initrd into memory and executes the Linux kernel.
6. Linux kernel re-initializes the hardware,  decompresses the initrd (initial root drive, a in-memory file system) and executes systemd init out of the initrd.
7. Various systemd and low-level utilities loads the basic set of Linux drivers (kernel modules) and configuration necessary to get the root file system mounted, among other things.  The root file system is defined by arguments to the Linux kernel provided by the grub configuration when it's executed.  Once the root file system is loaded the init does a 'root pivot' to switch roots from initrd to the rootfs.
8. Once systemd daemon has the proper rootfs it reads in /etc/fstab and numerous other configuration files, mounts the various file systems and continues to execute and configure the rest the hardware and daemons and other bits and pieces of the OS.

The major change that systemd brings to Linux is that it replaced the traditional configuration method, using shell scripting, with a DSL (systemd unit files).  This makes things much more predictable, deterministic, and portable.  The side effect of this is that much of the functionality that people previously had to write in shell is now integrated into the C language of the systemd product suite.

&#x200B;

The other thing systemd does differently then in the past for Linux is that it is much more event-driven.  Daemons can be loaded on-demand, for example.  So the operating system becomes a bit more self-optimizing.

It heavily leverages Udev (which pre-existed Systemd, but has been sucked into the project), as a message passing bus to deal with events.  You have two types of busses... a system-wide one and then user bus.  You can write software, for example, that listens for events over the system bus and carry out actions on behalf of users.

With this approach they eliminated much of the need for 'setuid root' and 'sudo' and such things to elevate user accounts to privilege status.  Instead privileged daemons can listen on the udev bus for messages from users and then use access control lists to determine if that user has that right or not.  It can react based on context, as well, so that a user logged in over SSH does not have the same privileges as one logged into a local desktop.  Although it does not tend to be heavily utilized by Linux software.

People have been trying to replace udevd for years with a much faster and secure method through building in a message-passing system into the Linux kernel, but so far it hasn't been accepted by the Linux dev community.

>how to open files in Wayland (does xdg-open even work there?),

Xdg-open is fine.

XDG is just a naming convention.  Think of the X more as a 'Cross' rather then 'X windows'.

[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)

Xdg-open executes commands based on file associations as defined by various \*.desktop files.  The desktop files define how to launch applications, menu entries, and various other metadata.  It's this metadata that is used by most desktops to fill in their menus and such things.

There is a default set of .desktop file associations, then there is file associations pre-configured for major desktops (ie: KDE and Gnome have their own sets of defaults). and then users can configure their own.   You can configure your own via right click menus or just by setting up configuration files in the proper locations.  User specific configurations end up in \~/.local/share/applications/

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG\_MIME\_Applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_MIME_Applications)

&#x200B;

MIME types is a convention that originated in methods used to identify file types set as email attachments.  Mimetypes is a IANA standard now and this was leveraged by XDG to identify file types, which is then used to configure their associated applications.",6,linux,natermer,

* **If my mom can't use Drill I've failed to design it**How can you even suggest stuff like ""just use locate"" (some of you did unironically) or ""did you try that obscure terminal command""?No and no, this is a GUI software for the average desktop user.
   * If your obscure terminal command doesn't spawn 1 thread per disk to scan I've already considered it a failure.
   * We are in 2019 and if the obscure search tool you recommended doesn't have a GUI to manage its options then it's a failure.
   * I decided to design Drill to be options-less, just a search input and a list, 100% usable for the average user to find his/her anime episodes.
      * If you want to customize the block list just rebuild it yourself or use the Portable .zip version
* ""Why don't just use a GUI frontend for updatedb?""Updatedb aged badly and was never intended for desktop users, it scans the entire system instead of ""human created files"", it's hard to configure for the average user, from what I've seen needs sudo to run and it's slow in network mounted drives.
* ""How you can compare it to Everything when it actually doesn't dump the NTFS file list?""In the beginning I actually designed it to dump the EXT4 partition just like Everything does with NTFS, there is a nice trick to do it but it's messy and requires sudo, then I realized I was making the same mistake of Everything, even the average user has sometimes network mounted drives just connected to the USB port of their router or other folders shared from other PCs using samba; with those types of virtual disks I can't dump the EXT4 or NTFS partition, and indexing would be SLOW; so I did some tests I realized the funny thing that I can find what I need just by crawling in less time than Everything needs to index the remote disk and then find the filename in the big list.
* The search on default Ubuntu GNOME is completely broken, when I tested Ubuntu I remember that it couldn't even find files I had in my secondary SSD mounted LOCALLY.
* ""How do I build it manually? I don't trust binaries""
   * Read the .travis.yml file
* ""Why did you use AppImage?""
   * Main reason is because it doesn't have dependencies at all, just libc and FUSE support.
   * I know that Ubuntu will provide snap by default and Fedora flatpak but it's not clear what other distros will do so a generic executable like AppImage is perfect
* ""Remove the .deb when it's published in the repository""
   * No, I see a .deb just like a Windows installer, until there will be a good """"""Play Store"""""" for Linux I will not remove it, Drill needs to be easy to install.
      * All the software centers GUIs I've tried are very very bad
* Some of you pointed out to rename it because a DNS tool called drill already exists, well if you have something like drill dns already installed you know what you are doing and know how to install drill without clashing it with the other drill.
   * Yes I will rename the binary in /usr/bin if that's really a problem and the package will probably be something like ""drill-search""
* I don't want to go off-topic but TL;DR: The reason I've used D is because it feels like writing Python but at the same time it's static and has nearly the performance of C.
* No I don't manage the Arch AUR repo, someone else made it
* About why I use Deepin:
   * It's based on Debian, nice to test Drill
   * Get a list of all Linux distros, remove the ones without the file picker thumbnails, and you just get Deepin and KDE Neon, after trying both I just stayed with Deepin because in my opinion the UI is less cluttered. KDE tries to do everything at once and has average UI everywhere, instead Deepin has probably 10x less the customization of KDE but at least the few UI elements there are better.
* Do you have any other idea for other GUI software that needs to be done that Linux has but it's outdated and old?
   * A universal GTK file picker with thumbnails for every distro
   * A clipboard history tool that is not crap
   * I thought about a Device Manager-clone
   * A good screenshot tool (tried almost all of them, even the Deepin one that is nearly a clone of the Windows one is very bad)

That's your opinion.  Again, this doesn't make a difference as you do not index the database synchronously and thus it doesn't matter in what order files appear in it.  Note that breadth-first search has a considerably higher memory requirement as the open list can get quite large.

No 1. is very weak. Give us Linux because we like Linux. You claim that it will attract people - this is just not realistic. I'd put that point further down the line as ""boosting morale"" sort of thing.

No.2 is very good. Specific point. Try to find issues that could have been avoided if only developers had easy access to full Linux experience. Developing for Linux without using it is like designing tampons by a strictly male team. This is honestly the only strong point here.

No.3 Hardware cost is tiny compared to total expenditure per person. Valid, but not very strong point.

No.4. same as above.

No.5. Is a no-no! Why do you have IT team? So your developers can focus on what they do best - developing. It is the same reason why your developers should not renovate the building. Personal experience - Engineers were allowed to build their own computers. Two weeks wasted.

To be more constructive, additional thoughts:

- saved license cost can be transferred towards training IT. 10 000 Eur saved is not much. 10 000 Eur to spend is a lot. If you show balance as zero - it looks much better. You solve the issue of IT now being familiar with Linux without added cost.

My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"Some thoughts:

- For security: any Linux computer can be controlled the same way as a server. So to check the security you can add the laptops to config management (ansible, puppet,...) This also makes it easy to install new software on machines. With apt-mirror you can host your own repository for software compatibility. (There's probably a yum equivalent for this.)

- I think the biggest issue is software compatibility. You have to make clear to users that choosing Linux won't allow them to have Microsoft office, Adobe,...

- the Linux desktop has really matured. You don't have to know command line anymore to use a system.

- the Ubuntu forums never failed to give an answer, often with pictures and howtos. Teach your users to use these wiki's.

- in my experience, Linux is a lot more stable if you pick LTS versions and software from the apt repos. This should lower helpdesk calls. For example: My parents, grandparents were all on Ubuntu 14.04. I never heard them and a couple months ago I upgraded them to 18.04. never heard of them in between... However they just use a browser, some documents and thunderbird.

- people often complain about their laptop becoming slower. Without serious cleanups on a Windows laptop every year, it really slows down a lot. On Linux/mac this problem never occured (in my experience).

- when there are serious issues, you can easily reinstall the OS if you keep a separate home partition. Also the reinstallation process of Linux is a lot faster than windows and Mac.

- you don't have to pay for overpriced Apple computers.

- a lot of applications are web based nowadays. So people often have many browser tabs open. Linux is conservative on killing browser tabs so people with low ram often experience lag. Make sure there is enough swap space. 
On 4GB ram laptops, I put a swap file of 10GB. People now open 50 tabs without issues. Standard Ubuntu install creates a swap file of 2GB which is way too small IMO.",2,linux,Optica1,

There are cons to Windows that you've mentioned, but I think you're arguing on the wrong points.

* License costs - arguing on this alone isn't effective for businesses. Most big companies (like yours sounds like) won't give a shit about license costs. They're pissing away probably 3k already on this meeting coming up on man-hours alone.
* Closed source, but most people don't give a shit.
* Personal preference. My company's policy is ""deal with it"". Personal preference isn't enough to warrant just changing our infrastructure. I can't argue on that.

&#x200B;

And there are pros to Windows, we have to be honest. The main pro for Windows is that it has taken over the world. Therefore, most infrastructure is available for it. This includes, but is not limited to...

\- Windows is the base OS for almost any laptop - the exceptions being Chromebooks (lol) and Macs. This means no up-front installation is required by your team.

\- There is more commercial ""IT"" software available for Windows and software like ""Team Viewer"", which makes remote IT support easy in Windows.

\- More people are likely familiar with it already.

&#x200B;

But each of these has a good counter

* It is easy to install a new OS no-problem, and your IT team will get good at it VERY quickly. This is a non-issue.
* While there isn't much (in my experience) ""enterprise"" IT support software for Linux computers, you also don't really need it.
   * You don't need a ""drive-mounting"" program for Linux - you have mount and /etc/fstab .
   * You don't need ""remote-logmein-5000"" for Linux - you have SSH. 
   * Want to create a bootable flash disk on Linux? cp debian.iso /dev/ttyUSB0 or whatever. One command, 3 seconds. Compare that to Rufus.
   * \-Need to wipe a hdd? sudo cat /dev/zero > /dev/sda .
   * Need to change an ip address? ifconfig interface ipaddr
* Installing new software for Linux computers is fool-proof. IT guy gets a request, he ssh's into the target workstation and runs sudo apt install thing. EZ mode.
   * Compare that to a remote-log in (which basically requires an appointment), or requiring the IT guy to show up at a person's computer with a physical flash drive containing an out of date binary for notepad++. Yeesh. The ssh method can happen without the employee even noticing.
* Windows may be familiar, but once your IT dept is good at Linux, they will be the best IT dept ever because of the high skill-ceiling for Linux machines vs Windows machines.
* And tell your IT guys not to lie to me on this one; there is no such thing as an ""intuitive"" computer. When you don't know something, you google it. Always. Linux, Mac, Windows, whatever. Your IT department does a LOT of googling.

&#x200B;

But the best long-term arguments I would give your company to (at a minimum) support multiple workstations is this.

* Modularity / agnosticism. Your company should allow employees to use multiple systems because then it's easier not to become too dependent on any of them.
   * This will drive more web-app focused corporate tools, which means that it's easier for your company to swap out tools if the developers / companies behind them become inexplicably stupid / evil (Looking at you, Microsoft)
* It allows your team exposure to new tools and ways of thinking. Do you \*really\* need office? I mean, right now, yes. But what if your team gets fed up with it? All of a sudden, you have Latex available at your IT guys ""sudo apt install"" fingertips, or you can simply edit text files in a markdown format much more easily with Vi or Emacs.
* I mean, you can be a fuckin wizard on Linux systems. The skill ceiling is near endless. I wrote a tool over this weekend to help my monthly data-entry spending tracking because no tools on the market were for me. Took me a day. Ez-mode.
* Imagine a world where the data entry girl doesn't need to spend 8 hours OT copying and pasting the same document format over 20 deliverables. She now has a tool at her disposal to automate that no problem.

&#x200B;

And there are big corporate plus points for Linux as well.

* The big distros support ~~grandma~~ user-friendly desktop environments.
* Full disk encryption out of the box - Just tick the box at install in Ubuntu.
* 2 factor authentication is supported with google-authenticator. Took me 5 seconds to find out how to set that up.

&#x200B;

But the biggest pro for using a Linux system on a regular basis (and a strong enough argument on its own for the entire world to use it) is how easy and safe it is to install new software.

* Linux distros come configured to point at trusted repositories for their software. This allows new software to be installed in one step; sudo apt install sofware. 
* Compare that to Windows, where you navigate to some janky site, dodge porn ads, avoid the popup, untick the box for the chinese ""download manager"", wait for bitfly, and then click past the malware warning because some guy on reddit said that we should ignore that but no really.

This is a crap argument. ""If I deploy on windows 2012R2 I should have a Windows 2012R2 machine to develop on."" You can use vms. If you are using vmware workstation the performance is comparable in a lot of situations, unless you are using a traditional hdd. If that is the case spend the extra money for a ssd. Every time I've heard a developer say "" it doesn't just work like it does on X"" it has pretty much been ""it's not a 1 for 1 match in instructions to do the same therefore it is a waste of my time."" You don't need 1 to 1 performance you should have a dev enviroment that is set up like a live environment for that purpose.

> **you'll save money on hardware**. 

Your arguments here are bad and it shows ypu never worked in IT. An ""expensive"" macbook vs a business level dell pricewise will probably be hundreds of dollars cheaper at best. It will NOT be easier to convert a linux laptop to windows because you will have to purchase licenses to accomodate said conversion and change support contracts for the hardware.

The fact that you state ""I have Libreoffice installed and, for the few times a month I have to open a PowerPoint presentation or an Excel spreadsheet, it is good enough"" but never asked other users how they use ot shows honestly that you are not the right resource for thos experiment.

Umm...you realize that IT doesn't have ome partner but several for supporting hardware?

Your not serious in suggesting that dev take IT responsibility here? Are you serious? Are you willing to put your ass on the line if you get compromises over instructions you create?

.....um im not sure how to answer this.



All of you arguments are from a dev point of view that has your workflow. You never bothered to ask IT about what they do or set up on your machines that isn't dev related. You never asked them what the per user licensing cost is. You state opposition from IT when honestly you don't understand what they do. You are also assuming macs will be allowed everywhere because of a small subset of users have macs. Your IT staff needs infrastructure to manage pc's. A vast majority of software exists for windows and macs. There is some linux. The problem is your IT does not have the know how for linux which means hiring people. I have looked into what you are doing, and it is only cost effective if your IT staff has the tools and knowledge base. I worked at a windows shop where sales hired a graphic artist who insisted on a mac even though all the software she used had a wimdows version. The IT manager asked me what we could do to ease the burden of support. I told him to have the sales mamager sign off that any extra support for this one person will come out of his budget because it was going to be expensive. The IT staff had to deal with so many issues because she refuses to accomodate anything with windows that IT literally showed that they were spemding 3 hours a day supporting her complaints and issues for the first year. Sales manager was not happy and even argued over his budget because he wasnt going to be able to upgrade his staff's equipment for another year. CTO pretty much told him to deal with it because he was warned and IT literally had to handle a one off.

You have 10 days. If you want to make a convincomg argument on the topic then you will have to ask IT for the following:

* average support cost of a windows user currently
* average support cost of a mac user at the beginning of when they started supporting macs
* average support cost of a mac user now and how long it took them to get there
* "" it doesn't just work like it does on GNU/Linux (their words, not mine)"" is a bs argument, especially when a lot of documentation about setting it up on windows pretty much indicates a small difference in setup that could be done voa script. What doesn't behave the same? What was done for root cause analysis on this?
* vm performance is poor. How so? 5%? 20%? You need metrics so you can convert said metric to lost time in work. For example, operation X on a real machine takes 2 hours but on my machine it is 2 hours and 5 minutes. Operation X is done once a day. Thats 25 minutes a week which over a year translates to a little under 22 hours. Will the extra development time make up the support costs?
* what is the cost difference for ordering a linux box vs a windows box vs a mac?
* does IT's current asset solution also handle linux? If not what was the research time and cost for their current solution.
* what is the licensing cost difference between a mac and windows?

You currently have no arguments other than ""devs will be happier"" but no numbers behind how much they would save. The bottom line is what matters. The fact that they are open to it means that they may be willing to invest if it makes developers more efficient and costs increases are minimal.",2,linux,vermyx,
My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"Sorry none of these are good reasons:

1. Why should employees get to choose their own OS? It isn't their computer, it isn't their business. Also there is various security implications, admin implications etc. Now most places will probably be alright. But at the moment everyone and their mother is getting hacked because people haven't taken security seriously. Security involved both physical (locking doors etc) to making sure programs are scanned and audited before being allowed to run on the network.
2. Why? WSL works exactly like Linux, they are simply lying. The number of incompatible programs with WSL is a handful of reported programs last time I bothered checking the list. It works perfectly fine. Also unless you are doing something like Linux kernel development I suspect that most of the languages / libraries you are using work fine cross platform. Maybe back in 2000s some things would work a bit wonky on Windows but not on Linux and vice versa but is rarely happens these days. Golang is major one I have encountered but I mainly use Python. C#, PHP, Ruby etc.
3. Hardware costs aren't as big of a deal as many people think. Say they buy a £6k iMac Pro it is a business asset and can be declared and they can claim tax back from the local tax authority.
4. Again I buy a JetBrains license every year. I could get all the same functionality with open source tooling but it just easier to pay the JetBrains license. A developers time is often more expensive than licensing.

&#x200B;

The security team is probably never going to be happy, and neither is the license management team. The desktop support team is probably closely aligned with the license management team, and they probably justify headcount based on how many systems they manage.... right? They might say it will cost millions of dollars for them to support another operating system -- so any cost savings you propose could be cut to shreds.

Go for the ""giving people what they want makes them happy and more productive"" angle.  That is simple and true.

If there's no cost or business impact to letting users who want Linux run Linux, why would you stop them? If you get resistance, try to turn the tables and make it the responsibility of the dissenters to defend not letting people run Linux. Does your company let people work from home on their own computers? Does IT manage home computers and support the users on them? Does your IT manage people's mobile phones?

This is your #1 reason, especially if your company has enough highly-paid people (e.g. developers) who want this. Would this company even consider skimping on hardware? Like, would it be so stupid as to put hard drives in developer machines, instead of SSDs, or to make developers jump through hoops to get a second monitor? Then why skimp on software?

For this, I think Steve Yegge has [a great rant](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/04/settling-osx-focus-follows-mouse-debate.html) that mirrors my experience working with other OSes:

> Given that I switched quite recently to the Mac, I'm still reeling from the lack of focus-follows-mouse behavior. To help you put yourself in my shoes, imagine that your latest operating system upgrade (whatever OS you happen to be running) includes a new mandatory feature wherein each time you click on a window to focus it, a loud alarm goes off (""BLONK! BLONK! BLONK! ..."") and you have to open the System menu and select ""silence window alarm"" to shut it up.

> That's what not having autofocus is like to people who've been using it for the past 10 to 30 years (in my case, 20 years). BLONK! BLONK! BLONK! I'm serious. It's that bad. Not exaggerating even a tiny bit.

And that's just one of *many* aspects of the desktop UI that Linux lets you customize, while Windows and OS X don't. Many of the best Linux developers have one thing or another about the Linux UI that they've gotten accustomed to over the years. Some people like tiling window managers, some like focus-follows-mouse, some like scripting their entire UI and carrying around a batch of custom keyboard shortcuts.

I'd argue this isn't just about being more productive, either. It's also about attracting and retaining top talent. If I were working at that company, pretty much any company that allows Linux on the desktop would find it easy to hire me away. (In fact, if I were in your shoes, I'd be looking already.)

> I got this answer from several colleagues. Some are very frustrated when they try to use Docker on Windows, even with the Windows Subsystem For Linux, because it doesn't just work like it does on GNU/Linux (their words, not mine). And yes, they can use VMs, but sadly the performances are not the same as running on the host OS (big frustration point).

Unfortunately for this argument [Microsoft is actively working on fixing all of that](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/). Yes, ultimately that means VMs, so maybe the performance will actually be subpar in some important way... maybe. And even if it is, Microsoft could still win the argument by being cheaper and Good Enough.

It's worth bringing up if you can find good, solid examples, or benchmarks that show where Linux-in-a-VM is actually slow, but otherwise, it's not really obvious why Linux-on-baremetal is better than Linux-on-Windows.

> This means buying dozens, if not hundreds, of expensive Mac Book Pro instead of cheaper and easily upgradeable Dell notebooks. It will also be easier to convert a GNU/Linux notebook into a Windows one and the other way around if, for some reason, someone is not happy with their choice.

Also seems unlikely to be persuasive. Like I said earlier, developers are expensive, so saving a few pennies on developer hardware shouldn't be a big deal. Heck, give people desktops *and* laptops -- I wouldn't mind a Mac so much if I only had to use it as a laptop during meetings, ssh-ing back into my desktop for any real work.

Same for the licenses -- even if they don't just have some blanket company-wide license, it's not likely to be a ton of money per-developer, especially compared to support costs.

Plus, what's hard about putting Windows on a Macbook?

> a) if Helpdesk doesn't want to do it, an external partner could provide support. In opposition to the Windows world, where you can deal only with one partner for support,

Not actually true. MS may be the only ones who can dig into the code and fix it, but you can certainly get *helpdesk*-level support from multiple vendors.

> on the GNU/Linux world there are plenty of partners that would love to offer their support, like Canonical or Suse. b) if Helpdesk doesn't want to do it, the community can provide support.

These are okay points, but not a substitute for actually getting IT buy-in.

Linux is easiest to support with a you-break-it-you-buy-it model. As in, helpdesk wouldn't need to support every Linux configuration under the sun, only a few blessed ones -- you'll pick a DE (GNOME? KDE? Cinnamon? One of those) to be the officially-supported one.

One downside of Linux is lack of proper built in central management including login accounts and authentication.  Yeah you can script stuff or setup really complicated setups where it goes against defaults using 3rd party stuff, but most IT people don't really want to homebrew a bunch of scripts or configure really complex stuff to do things that are turn key in Windows. Whatever steps are involved need to be repeated on every single workstation.  In a windows environment you have AD, as well as various deployment tools and it's only a few clicks to join a domain and then everything works.  

Also NTFS is superior to Linux's permission system.  Users ask for the most whacked permission schemes sometimes and you need to be able to provide that. A simple user, group, global is just not going to cut it.  Karen needs to be able to list files in folder A, create/edit, but not be able to delete, John however needs full read/write access to the same folder. Dave needs read only access, but to be allowed to create folders, and only folders.  Good luck doing that with Linux's permission system.   Also in Linux permissions there's no inheritance, so every file has it's own permissions and it can become a mess. 

I would love to see Linux in an enterprise environment myself but after actually doing IT, it's sadly just not suited for it for those reasons and others alone.  Sure there may be some stuff you can do with Samba to join a domain, and use other management tools etc, but these are all extra steps you have to do on every single PC and won't be turn key. Some of them are very tedius like having to setup LDAP and Kerberos etc.   It's great for servers like local intranet servers, etc or other dedicated tasks but for workstations Windows is just so much easier to manage, even with it's annoyances. Everything is turn key once you get past the blue screens of death.  

That said, if this is an environment where desktop management is not a big deal because everything is web based and users manage their own local workstations, then I say go for it.  The savings in licensing costs alone makes it worth it.  Windows is freaking expensive in an enterprise environment, especially once you start to introduce things like Office, Exchange etc.  Everything is per PC and per user, I always found that licensing model absurd.   Add Citrix to the mix and now you're basically paying 3+ times for everything.  Citrix license per user, (and per server I think), Windows license per user, (the remote session requires a separate license on top of local workstation!) and finally a license for the software itself that's being launched via citrix.

Maybe you wouldn't buy one yourself, but with DEP and a proper MDM, deloyment and management is easy as piss and the OS is rock-solid (hardware...meh, we've been lucky with the keyboard issues on the MBPs so far). Linus is cool and all, but I much prefer to just spin up a CentOS VM in our datacenter, or locally through VMWare Fusion than actually work in it all day. Almost every single one of our devs uses a Mac, managed by me with Jamf, and it honestly takes up a very small amount of my time. It takes me the same amount of time to deploy a single Macbook as it does an order of 500 iMacs, which is to say, about 2 minutes of clicking. 

But what I can say is this. IT Security is a hybrid of both IT and HR. I can do my best to secure my fleet of Macs, ensure they're up to date, encrypted, and so on, but ultimately, I'm handing over a computer to someone. If they have physical, day to day access, I assume that people will try and succeed in breaking shit, or doing things that are against policy. My job isn't to herd those cats, or be the police. I hand out managed tools to make people's jobs easier, and if they break them, then they have to answer for it, not me.

Ultimately, the only thing I'd care about as far as Linux endpoints go is reporting. I'd want to know exactly what is installed, how it was installed, what the state of specific security policy compliance issues are (full disk encryption, desktop backups, password policies and LDAP configs). We recently had one developer who used Linux on his endpoint, and basically, we told him, we don't have the man-power or money to boot-strap a Linux management service, so you're on your own. Here is IT security policy, you need to be logging in with your LDAP creds, backup your shit with this software, encrypt your disk, and don't be stupid. Linux users are just de facto going to be more technical than your average graphic designer or accountant, they can probably easily handle these tasks on their own, and helpdesk calls are going to likely be zero, they'll try and fix everything themselves. 

So, I'd look into proper endpoint reporting, so when someone forgets their laptop at a coffee shop, OfficeIT can cover their asses and say ""look, it checked into our reporting server an hour before it went missing, and it is listed as encrypted, and backed up, so the company's data is safe"", and then HR/purchasing can deal with the employee for losing equipment (which is small fry to losing potentially protected data). After that, everything else is an HR problem. Draw up proper acceptable use policies and basically say that ""If you're going to use a Linux machine, we'll buy you one, and maybe set it up, but maintaining things, helpdesk stuff, all that, is on **you**"".

Or, more easily, without having to make this a political fight, simply tell OfficeIT that they can force Windows on everyone, but they need to purchase and deploy proper enterprise grade hypervisor applications to everyone's machines so that devs can have a proper dev environment to do their jobs in. Honestly, VMs are so so much easier than bare-metal anyways, because you can break shit all you want and just revert to snapshot.",1,linux,wpm,

My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"* Less attack surface for malware and other threats.
* Has many good options for centralized management.
* Very easy to mass deploy, just clone an original machine, then allow the package manager to update everything and you are ready to go. All this can be streamlined to a ""insert USB drive, power on, wait"". Similar things can be done with Windows, but is more work, more complicated and takes more time.
* Separation of user data and everything else, which means that if a machine should go strange, just wipe it, re-clone, update and put in the old user data, and the user should have ""his own"" machine back, with all settings. The helpdesk will like this, basically, a single script can do it all. Windows can't do this at all, a new install is raw, you have to redo all your settings, for all your programs.
* Strict policies can be set. It's possible, through centralized management, to set exactly what each user can, and cannot do. Windows is very weak in this regard.
* For developers, it's important to match target environments. I've done cross platform dev, and it never works well, despite what the dev tool company promises. You always run into strange stuff. Virtual machines help a little, but some strange things remain.
* For devs, it has powerful scripting capabilities, which makes it easy to automate many processes, such as building and unit testing. Can be done in Windows, but that's like saying ""I can dig with a spoon as good as an excavator"".
* It's an emergent technology. More and more customers are using Linux, especially on the server side, but also in automation and situations where ""failure is not an option"". The customers will want to know that you walk the walk, not just talk the talk. There are way too many companies who send someone to a class for a week, then sell them as ""experts"", and the customers know this. If you can say ""Well, 60% of our developers works on Linux every day, by their own choice"", the customers will KNOW that not only do they have real experience, they have something more important: a burning personal interest in the platform, and you'll have the customer hook, line and sinker.
* License costs. Don't underestimate how much license costs can build up for a large organization. Typically, the license costs for a typical Windows machine in an office setting is more than the cost of the machine, and for a developer, it can easily run up to 3-5 times the cost of the hardware (even if you count the more expensive hardware of a dev machine). Many of the licenses today are also not ""buy once and be done with it"", it's ""pay a fee every year"".
* Guaranteed costs. You know that license fees won't suddenly skyrocket, as GPL just makes someone else take up the torch and continue with a free product. Say, for example, if Apple were to go out of business, what would happen to Windows license costs then?

We had that happen in a very high-end facility using regular HDMI cables. The working theory is that they started disappearing when someone took one or two offsite (for sales) and never returned them, but the rest disappeared because hoarding them was the only way to ensure a cable was available after that point.

I've seen a similar thing happen with computer mice and with laptop power supplies. The things that disappear aren't particularly expensive, they're the items that someone wants on short notice. But if you let there become any kind of a persistent shortage, you'll find more and more disappearing into locked drawers as people hoard them.

That's why I always recommend that institutional purchasers buy and issue two power supplies for each laptop, so that the user can leave one at home and one in the office. You're saving time and money by doing it up front instead of when they go missing or get ""lost"", and everyone's happier and more productive.

My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"This is the single best reply in this entire thread. /[u/leinardi](https://www.reddit.com/user/leinardi/) if you want any chance of success, these are the things you need to consider. The reality is Linux is going to cost your organisation more than Windows. So I'll add some points to /u/vermyx that might help you form some good approaches to getting this across the board.

&#x200B;

1. Licensing costs are basically nothing. Your wage for 1 hour would more than cover the monthly licensing costs for a Windows machine + Office. 
2. With Linux you will need a support contract from a vendor. So you'd be stuck with RHEL, SuSe, Ubuntu etc. Don't try to push an unsupported distro; businesses want assurances that if you leave they can ring someone to help them. This also ensures the business can have experts on call or available to contract if necessary from the vendor. Many organisations will use Microsoft services as part of their contracts when doing upgrades etc.
3. It's a great opportunity for your organisation to invest in training/professional development for their staff making them more versatile. The skills they learn can allow staff to better work across teams (e.g. Windows and Linux guys in the same team working together).
4. Find ways to show how Linux can integrate into the existing environment to help operations/security/compliance. Linux can be configured to use Active Directory so you should be talking to your Ops team about how this works so they can understand it and be comfortable. If you use cloud file storage like GDrive, OneDrive.. show how this can work with your Distro.
5. Provide a solution with costings for patching the systems and deploying software. Try to work with Ops to come up with a high level concept that they will back. Bring security in for the conversation to get their blessing. 
6. Consider how asset management is done. Figure out who does it now and how. Will your Linux solution work with their current processes/tools?
7. Check with your Legal/Regulatory/Compliance teams to see if there is anything special you need to consider. If there isn't, make sure you raise this as something you've considered.

&#x200B;

All n all, the business is looking for you to come with answers/solutions and an idea of the costs/benefits. If you play the philosophical game (cost/licensing/GNU/FOSS) you will lose. Linux will cost more than Windows, Microsoft have built an entire ecosystem around Windows that is easy to use and does MANY MANY things (Azure, Exchange, Office, Malware Protection, Active Directory etc). Linux is just an Operating System, so you need to fill in the gaps in some way.",1,linux,ZaitaNZ,
My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"> Why should employees get to choose their own OS? It isn't their computer, it isn't their business.

My company is asking me if Linux should be allowed as employee OS. Need good arguments to convince them!,"> WSL works exactly like Linux, they are simply lying.

There's quite significant differences.

1. WSL has no support for GUI. You can get a local X11 server installed on Windows (e.g. VcXsrv or X410), but there's no graphical acceleration and Qt5 apps currently do not work unless you strip the .note.ABI section from them.

2. WSL's file I/O handles quite differently. It's slow as hell, especially if you keep Windows Defender or any other AV enabled, and compiling, say GCC, takes ages due to this. Moreover, the Windows access system is leaking into WSL; you can't delete a folder you've currently cd'd into for example. This can break scripts, and I've seen precisely that happening.

3. There's no systemd whatsoever, and no dbus running.

4. A complete lack of cgroups, SELinux, AppArmor, … make it behave different as to when deploying on actual Linux. Not to mention you can't use anything that requires an actual Linux kernel to be present, say using OProfile (or Intel VTune).

5. The kernel API is in a lot of ways lacking behind, there's a number of APIs missing (e.g. SysV IPC) and others behave differently.

6. All that aside, there's a handful of Linux distros supported for WSL, and RHEL isn't one of them. RHEL defaults to SELinux, uses different paths or software versions than say Ubuntu.

If you deploy to Linux, WSL can be a very useful tool, but that's about it. It doesn't support services or the likes for good reason - it's a tool to ease development and bridge Windows and Linux, not to eliminate or replace Linux. Using WSL to test for production is not a good idea.",2,linux,ChrisTX4,

At only 1000 employees your firm isn't that large and unless a massive fraction of employees wanted Linux it wouldn't be cost effective to focus on making Linux a first class system at the firm.

Instead you want your #2 point to guide things. You will be a more effective employee of you can use tooling that is more in line with production systems. You can access those tools either with a modest investment in hardware (a single laptop lease is a small fraction of an FTE cost), or some free virtualisation.

It's a a new OS, with different versions of existing applications - Libre Office is the best example OP cited.. not to mention the Linux version of X app, if available.

The truth is that there are no *direct* cost-savings from getting rid of Windows on the desktop in organizations already using it at scale, especially if you're using OEM licenses. The direct cost savings only come from getting rid of the large number of ancillary servers and services that accumulate: AD-DCs, WSUS, MDT, SCCM, Exchange, IIS, RDS/TS, MSSQL, Sharepoint, Lync, and the CALs to go with them. 

I count six types of CALs that a client user/device might need, though Project Server CALs are probably rare, and I've mostly seen Sharepoint CALs tossed in as a bundle. I've heard of Sharepoint CAL prices getting expensive after a enterprise decides to implement it to use the ""free"" bundled licenses, though.

As for ""regular"" USB ports, they will simply be obsolete  in 5-10 years, they simply hold no benefit over USB-C besides manufacturing cost, as well as sunken investment cost in other peripherals.

I wish people understood that, especially the cultural 'hipsters' entering some professional environment (whether as employees or that they founded themselves).

In the era of cross-platform and virtualization (all great, awesome things in and of themselves), you still need to test and often write your software on the actual target OS.

I know, revolutionary:

- Linux software on Linux
- Windows software on Windows
- MacOS software on MacOS
- iOS software tested on iOS (and written on MacOS)
- Android software tested on Android (written on any but Linux makes more sense imho)

It doesn't help your company to have one set of platforms in-house and another set for customers targets. Eat your own damn dog food and stop thinking _any_ platform is ""the best"". It's only the best for software that runs on it.

>different culture

Nailed it. Everything you said below that is just so true.

People tend to lump together the characteristics of startups (of anything really), black-and-white thinking, as if everything about them was bad (or good). The truth is, in the early 2000's, from a managerial / organization stanpoint, startups basically implemented a much saner approach on a human level, by removing *a lot* of unnecessary constrains. Not everything can be generalized to big structures, of course, but some salient elements made their way to mainstream organization by now.

- work hours and remote etc. only matter when there's interaction with others than needs to be synchronous (phone calls, meetings, etc). If people are responsibly delivering on their job, why add artificial time constrains?

- having a pool or video games to relax is arguably better than doing facebook or angry birds on a phone. Besides the impracticality of some of these things in large corporation buildings, I never understood the cultural backlash back then. I think people were just salty, mostly. 

    I remember in the early 2000's I worked at a place (300ish employees, 50 on-site HQ) where the CEO was adamant we had a ""reading room"" with tons of books, magazines, coffee and snacks --- it was in Paris, he was a book lover, he liked antiques too and the building was 200 years olds with beautiful stones, the furniture was oh-so-Classic too... it really was something, that room. Felt like some elite club. You'd never liken that to a startup video game room. Yet it achieved the exact same purpose, and many of us loved it. CEO personally spent ~1K/month to pay for that room's expenses (regardless of annual profit and his bonuses), and brought books himself almost every week, his way of giving back. I never paid for 1 coffee in the 18 months I stayed (and it was damn good coffee too). Oh, btw, the room had been there since 1987. QOL is a thing. Didn't wait for startups.

- choosing your work environment, in any domain, is better than not. Period. So everything a company can do to make employees feel comfortable to work should be tried. Every single employee is serving other people, whether externally (e.g. customers) or internally (in-house service). 

    In consulting we call this ""servant leaders"" for managers/execs, and it trickles down to everyone when real enough. Wherever you fall on this spectrum, from the 'servant' mindset (we provide, we are here to give whatever we can, that's how we _make_ value) to the 'territorial' mindset (we conquer, we are here to take whatever we can, that's how we _hoard_ value) ultimately decides your agility as a company / team / individual. Are you afraid of losing value, or are you willing to create some (thus necessarily both for yourself and others)?

Essentially I think it's a basic economic principle: value, like mass, doesn't ""do"" anything by itself (the greatest service with the greatest minds is worth nothing if it doesn't help anyone). Value is only ""felt"", thus impactful, when it _moves_, when it's projected at something and put in motion (e.g. the transfer of service skills to improve everyone's environment, that is when value is extracted from this service department to benefit materially every other department, or customer). In fact, we encourage people to think of everybody as a customer, especially in-house employees. 

It's an almost 1:1 correlation that companies who fail to 'serve' their own goal (the ""higher-than-us"", ""why we do this"") tend to crawl under their own weigth, collapse at the hand of their own structure (instead of being conducive to good work, it becomes detrimental to it). That's when the best employees leave, or left already if they saw it coming.

You hear the word ""culture"" thrown left and right from blogs to harvard business studies, well that's what it comes down to in real life in my limited / educated experience. Are you serving or are you taking, are you empowering others freely or defending your perceived power (let alone be hostile), are you a collection of mutually eating parasites or are you creating more value together than you ever could in isolation. That goes for how you treat external customers as well, if we are talking sustainability.

Ah.... I'm rambling. So many years of consulting. Always the same stories, and they almost always end up in failure. I don't even take those jobs anymore, it's a lost cause and I'd rather save the good people there than the company itself at that point.",3,linux,StoicGrowth,

NT4's reputation for crashing was almost entirely due to poor-quality third party drivers and hardware, after Microsoft's fateful decision to put the graphics and printing subsystem into protected memory space in order to equal the performance of Unix X11 CAD machines.

The crashes were so bad, that Microsoft locked the *resolution* of Server 2003 in order to indirectly discourage anyone from installing a graphics-card driver.

Ans to #1: Yes it should be possible to start the script without the dialogs popping up, just uncheck the 'show at start' checkbox in the help dialog. Or is it not working for you as intended? It should be at the bottom of the dialog next to the 'Close' button.

\#2: No, currently one can't send commands to a running instance. I suppose this need was alleviated once you got the keybindings to work? Would this be an important feature even with the keybindings?

You can do this if you know how to use the terminal. 
You need to be root. 
I did this on linuxmint tina. 

The ""file"" that controls your keyboard backlight SHOULD be in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ and named KBDBacklitLvl-5af56f53-985c-47d5-920c-f1c531d06852 (mine was) but first navigate to that directory in your file manager and find it, make sure that it has the same name before copy and pasting stuff into the terminal. If the file name is different, you just have to substitute ""KBDBacklitLvl-5af56f53-985c-47d5-920c-f1c531d06852"" for the name of your file in the instructions. 

open terminal

sudo su 

type in your password

now you're root and can follow the instructions in that link. ""chattr -i"" removes the immutable (not modifiable) flag, so that you can change the value. 

I set it to ""03"" for max brightness, not 02. (remove echo 0700000002 from the second command and replace it with echo 0700000003) 

you need to reboot afterwards.

hope this works for you and any other human who is trying to make the pretty keys work on their samsung laptop. also, the keys are controlled by an ambient sensor so if they don't come on when you first reboot, don't despair, first cover the sensors next to your webcam and see if the lights come on.",1,linux,anotheranothername,
I fixed keyboard backlight on my Samsung Notebook 9,"Hey, thanks for this workaround. It's possible to control the lights through the dedicated key, too?",1,linux,yeahparanoia,
I fixed keyboard backlight on my Samsung Notebook 9,"No. This will just enable them so that they come on when it's dark or you cover the sensor (next to the blue power light, I was wrong about where the sensor is) 

The kernel module ""samsung-laptop"" is still excluded because it could theoretically brick your laptop (sort of what OP is about) , so my understanding is that until someone makes a new driver that makes the keys work out of the box or with like ""xset led 3 on"", setting the values the way it's done in my post above is the only way, other than OPs way. 

Maybe something could be written but I don't know how. The way keycodes/scan codes/kernel/efivars interact is way over my head. Efivars are brought in sometime during boot I think. 

My understanding is that even if you get the system to understand that pressing the key=lights on, it may not work. 
For me i don't care that the button doesn't work, I just want the backlight to come on when it should, so I'm happy, even though I'll never get that Saturday and sunday of my life back.",1,linux,anotheranothername,

The Year of desktop Linux post are stupid,"My opinion is that the very things that we Linux users love about our platform are the same things that have prevented it from becoming a real contender as a viable desktop alternative to Windows or macOS.  The OP is absolutely right in that Linux is all about choice.  Unfortunately that choice has splintered Linux into 300 active distributions.  There are now at least 18 desktop environments.  There are over 40 music players alone to choose from.  There are even more than 20 sys init systems.  The choices go on and on and forks, which can be done by any person or group add even more confusion.  Can you imagine trying to manage a help desk for mainstream Linux users who are lay people who purchased a computer running Linux pre-installed?  It would be a nightmare!  Sure there are some hardware vendors who ship Linux systems but those are aimed for developers and Linux geeks like us, not for mom and dad.

&#x200B;

Our best hope for Linux on the desktop is for Microsoft to eventually release its own Linux distribution.  It would really be a win-win for Microsoft because it could release its version of Linux with a desktop environment that would be nearly indistinguishable from modern Windows 10 which would make it easier for mainstream Windows users to adopt.  Microsoft wouldn't have to worry about quality control or upgrade disasters because the open source community would continue to maintain and update the underlying packages of the system.  Microsoft could even make a substantial code donation to the WINE project which would ensure backward compatibility with existing Windows software.  Microsoft seems to be slowly inching its way towards this outcome.  Incorporating a full linux kernel into WSL 2 is one step in the right direction.",4,linux,Linux4ever_Leo,

Apple recently announced that there will be no OS installed on their hardware other than MacOS.

This takes the form of a auth code that needs to be entered by the service facility. Failure of this code or unauthorized repairs may BRICK your device. The simple act of replacing your HDD or RAM may junk your machine.

Now look at the iPhone. If Apple decides that they don't agree with an app they can remove it from your phone. Now imagine that is extended to your PC. You want GIMP? Too bad - buy Photoshop. You installed Chrome - Safari is now the only browser authorized. It wouldn't take much to make it happen and the walled garden approach protects the average user.

https://www.osnews.com/story/24882/the-history-of-app-and-the-demise-of-the-programmer/

># The demise of the programmer

> What I find most interesting about ‘app’ is the juxtaposition between the widespread use of the term 30 years ago, and the petty squabble over the app store trademark today. The programmers of yore used the term not because a marketing team told them to – they used it because they didn’t have much of a choice. Whether it was small displays forcing them to use abbreviations, file extensions limited to three characters, or job postings charged per character – the people that used the term every day 30 years ago used it because of the constraints they had to deal with every day.

> The squabble today over the app store trademark illustrates better than I ever had imagined just how much the technology world has changed over the years. It used to be a world defined by its constraints, full of people trying to get the most out of the limited resources they had within these constraints. Today, the technology world seems far more concerned with silly patents, obvious trademarks, bezels, icon design, and whether or not Michael Arrington is a douche.

> Thirty years ago, ‘app’ was used because programmers decided to use it, because it made the most sense within the constraints they were forced to deal with. Today, ‘app’ is used because the marketing department has decided to use it – or not, because the legal department has decided it can’t be used.

Incorporating it into a real-time payment system is a bit different sure, but there exist various implementations across Europe (CB, Sofort, iDeal) that work to some extent cross border even. Most banks also have apps that allow others to scan a QR code or send a request through sms/email/social media and pay them that way, which is free, works between (most) banks.

But, for Patreons use case, simple bank transfer as have been available since the internet would actually suffice, even recurrent transfer are trivial to setup.

* I pay 5$ to have my small video added to a hosting farm. YT is free right now, so this should be feasible: make content creators pay a small fee to be on a CDN
* Protocol that incentivizes seeding via micropayments, or a system that shares success from massively popular streams with smaller ones (""tax the rich"")
* Create incentives for people that share small streams, and don't reward popular streams as much

I think BitTorrent is still largely run on goodwill. People want to share, but aren't really obligated to at all. Adding crypto to the mix is necessary for the next gen systems -- one example is DTube, but they are running on kind of a weird system, and it's far from perfect

I started uploading there just to see my videos stop working within a month. This is because despite the D for decentralised, it's not actually decentralised.

Your videos are stored on DTubes servers, they store it for a week and then take a cut of your rewards to pay for further storage. In other words, if you don't get a lot of rewards, your videos will simply go into an endless loading loop.

It should be possible to put up your own ipfs node so you can store your own videos, but after looking into it I couldn't figure out how. I'd say this is not feasible for most people.

I find [LBRY](https://api.lbry.com/user/refer?r=3kQu1oESt3X91whKCJgJqCaT9GV6RW23) to be a far better alternative to YouTube as it's *actually* decentralised. You download and install the app from their website linked above and this is now basically a BitTorrent client. You publish your video, or song, or whatever (it supports other formats than videos) and then you basically seed your own content in a true decentralised fashion.

That being said, LBRY has reflector servers that download and seed your content for when your computer/LBRY app is not running.

You can also put a price on your content and get 100% of the proceeds (minus a small transaction fee), or people can tip you if you put your content up for free.

It's still in beta, so a bit rough around the edges and lacking some features (no comments section yet, no live streaming yet, etc). But I think this one has the most potential out of all the alternatives. I've basically looked into/tried them all, DTube, BitChute, BitTube, PeerTube, Alexandria, you name it.

The big attraction of AMD in a laptop is that their single-chip solutions provide decent performance. We should see a new generation soon which should be a decent upgrade. Depending on what games you're wanting to play, and what kind of performance you're looking for considering how long you kept your old system they may be more than enough. If games aren't a consideration, there's very little reason to not simply go for a single chip solution from Intel or AMD.

I've been using AMD on various desktop and laptops for the last 10 years.  I don't install proprietary drivers, everything works out of the box for me. (Notable exception:  Lenovo E485/E585 which is a ryzen chipset., Lenovo has a fucked up bios they refuse to fix, which causes non-boot in linux without a few specific kernel boot parameters, otherwise it's fine).

I'm a fan of the AMD APUs.  I don't know what performance you need, but as far as being able to play 1080P+ videos on youtube, the open source driver works perfectly for me.

On the desktop, I have some AMD discrete graphics card.  I don't remember what it is, Radeon R5 something or other.  It just works.  I use it for HDMI out to my monitor, sound and video work fine.  (Though, in newer distros, pulse audio is fucked up, and requires a tweak or there's some audio delay.  Again, not the fault of the AMD drivers IMO).

Performance is on par or better in the open-source driver, to the point that AMD has recommended the open-source driver for general purposes and gaming for around a year now. Basically, it's just professional applications with a strict compatibility matrix that should be using the AMDGPU-PRO binary driver for new deployments, now.

Features-wise, the open-source driver was slightly lagging in a couple of things: OpenCL, FreeSync, HDMI Audio, and slightly in Vulkan (RADV vs. AMDVLK), but the open-source driver is very close in feature-parity now. The only feature that might lead someone to use the PRO driver would be OpenCL, and even then there's a way to combine the PRO OpenCL with the open-source driver.

The bottom line is that Nvidia's Linux support today is very much the same as it was ten years ago, as it was fifteen years ago, more -- quite good. So is Intel's (open-source) support, for that matter -- just the same as it always was. What's changed is that after an extended effort, AMD has gone from an inferior closed-source driver far behind Nvidia, to an open-source driver that's at least equal to Nvidia and [quite literally getting better every day](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_topic&q=Radeon).",9,linux,pdp10,

Well, I've only been seriously looking since I made the OP, and it's been a bit sporadic.  No matter what, I'm a month-ish from being ready to order for other reasons.  If a near-miracle happens I could be ready in about three weeks, but that's unlikely.  I guess my point is that others may have a more educated opinion.

However, I've decided that if I can possibly swing it, I'm going for something RTX 2080 based.  That puts you north of 2K in any reasonable configuration that I've seen - which for my purposes includes:

An nvme ssd of not less than 256GB, 16GB RAM as the firm minimum (more preferred), ethernet port as a nice to have, and thunderbolt as a nice to have.  

Originally I liked the idea of a 2K screen as something greater than 1080P, but still avoiding some of the possible pitfalls of hidpi, especially if I'm trying to stay with a 15"" form factor.  It turns out that there are zero 2K options among laptops I would otherwise consider.  But, from a longevity standpoint, I think not being able to push more than 1080p isn't going to be an *actual* problem for a good long while, and conserves the resources of the card.  So 1080p it is.  I could understand looking for 4K, but I don't think it's for me just yet.

At least some resellers are offering 3GHz RAM as an upgrade, and I think nearly every 2080 system I've seen has offered an i9 as the top CPU.  It's been too long since I have looked at this kind of thing though, and I know sometimes those sorts of obvious seeming upgrades don't bring quite the performance jump you might expect.  So I still need to do some research regarding whether those are worth paying a bit more for compared to the other choices.

I do intend to check out the Sager reseller I used previously - he had a good price and was nice to work with.  However, I stumbled upon a discussion thread somewhere involving a guy who had actually called several resellers and asked them how much if any part they had in the build process etc.  And he came out highly recommending pro-star, so that's where I'm landing so far.  I haven't noticed the same machine for less anywhere else with the same specs.

[This](https://www.pro-star.com/specs/p960rn) is my ""pretend I don't have a budget"" choice at this time.  If it doesn't work out, I think I saw some non-MaxQ RTX 2070 or 2060 systems - I might see if I an snag one of those for significantly less.  My understanding is there's 10% peformance hit from MaxQ, but it looks like most people aren't offering the non-MaxQ variants.

Spec'd the way I'd want it as of today, it rolls in at $2469.

If you think you are likely to buy *after* me, I'll keep you posted on what I eventually get and how I feel about it.

sigh... There is a good reason to put full chips in laptops. You can have more performance at a much lower clock. In notebooks, large issue with performance isnt the chip. It the amount of memory lanes you can put without breaking your power budget.

It rolls in a smidge costlier than the Sager/Clevo I posted previously -- OTOH it's an IPS display and solid aluminum chassis.

I have had a really hard time finding any reviews about it though.  Apparently until just a few days ago, you couldn't get the 9th Gen i7 and RTX 2080 - so even reviews from a week ago are looking at somewhat different specs.

I don't see anything there that jumps out at me as likely to be a compatibility issue.  I still haven't googled to see if there are any particular issues with that CPU, but my understanding is that it's just the 8th gen version with 2 more cores, so I'm guessing it should be safe.

If we remove cost (I'm still pretending no budget) can you think of any reason to strike this one from the list?

>It’s hard to do direct comparisons between CUDA and OpenCL

It's not necessary to have a direct comparison between CUDA and OpenCL since there is application-level optimization that takes advantage of the parallel computing framework. Though I leave a link of a paper, which has been cited a few times, at the bottom of my comment for your reference. In fact, CUDA and OpenCL are just frameworks and for most applications that supports both, it is observed that the application tends to run faster with CUDA due to the level of engineering/software support at the application level.

&#x200B;

>but to say that’s due to something intrinsic in the framework design is disingenuous.

No one said that exactly.

Like I said, it depends on the application-level utilization of the parallel computing scheme. Anyone familiar with the topic knows that CUDA has received better support, and hence systems with CUDA + GPU usually enjoys higher performance due to the level of optimization at application level.

An awesome linux guy is in recovery. It's the community's turn to help him this time.,"For a less succinct summary, heres a recent bestof post outlining pay ceilings in US health care: https://np.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/azsr2p/a_subreddit_where_you_can_post_outragous_hospital/eia99xc/

TLDR: 
When you get healthcare, you make 4 types of payments. 

 1. They are monthly payments (for insurance itself) 
 
 2. Copays (After making monthly payments, each time you visit the Dr., you'll have to pay a copay for the services performed. This amount varies depending on services needed)
 
 3. Annual deductible (this is a limit you and your insurance company agree upon. The lower the more expensive insurance. Some deductibles are anywhere from 1.5k-10k. So until this limit is reached, you will pay for 100% of copays)
 
 4. Out of pocket ceiling (after paying monthly fees, and reaching your deductible, you'll still be expected to pay 20%, or whatever percentage agreed upon, of all incurred fees until this new limit has been reached.)


But wait, there's more. 4 caveats to be exact.

1. All of the above only applies to medical institutions that your insurance has approved. So if you want to go to a Dr. that your insurance doesn't approve of, tough luck. Or if you change jobs, and subsequently, insurances, there is a chance of your current doctor not being approved by your new insurances. And changing doctors is a clusterfuck, logistically. Even more sor medically: for example, you need start a new relationship with a new doctor that doesnt know your past medical history as intimately and could miss important symptoms not noted in medical history due to its seeming irrelevance.

2. Once the new year begins, all spending is reset and you have to pay all over again. So if you get hurt at the end and then beginning of the year, prepare to pay up. For example, with a 5k deductible and 2.5k out of pocket ceiling at 20%, you could pay atleast 7.5k in December after paying out the nose all year for insurance while not visiting the doctor. Once January roles around, you get hurt again, expect to pay another 7.5k since your spending was just reset at the new year. So at a minimum, 15k in two months. While still having insurance. 

3. This is forgetting about lost wages (hopefully you're salary)/opportunity/long term disability/ mental well being/ etc.

4. And still, this is forgetting other medical insurance like dental, vision, life, etc. This is just one facet of many insurance types comprising this racket.

That is the same in the UK I believe, but most good health schemes at work will pay for some fixed time if you're off due to critical illness. There is also critical illness insurance, and its pretty much expected you'll take this insurance out yourself if you ever get a mortgage, of at least sufficient value to pay for the mortgage payments while you're ill, but you can arrange more",1,linux,QAOP_Space,

An awesome linux guy is in recovery. It's the community's turn to help him this time.,"I don't really know, if its better. Here in germany, health insurance, social insurance, etc are paid by you (me) and your company. How much you have to pay depends on your monthly incomings. Health insurance - for example - is at around 14% of your monthly incomings. But you just have to pay half of it and the other half is paid by the company you work for. So 7% for me and 7% for my boss. The fees and taxes I have to pay are taken from my incomings by the company I work for. They pay it - together with their part of it - directly to goverment and insurances. So when my money arrives at my bank account, those taxes and fees are already paid.

Whenever I need a doctor, I just go there. I hand over my insurance card and thats it. No extra fees or payments. When I need some medicine, most of it is covered by health insurance as well. You do have to pay a small fee, but thats like $7 I guess. And once your payments for medicine reach 2% of your annual incomings, you are free of those payments for the rest of the year. In case you are chronically ill, you don't even have to pay those 2%. All I have to buy and pay myself are things like mild painkillers, nasal spray, etc. But they are cheap here. 

German law says, that your company has to pay you for up to 6 weeks, even you are not working. So even you are sick for a month, you will get your regular payment (except bonus payments like when you work on sunday). After those 6 weeks, your health insurance will pay you. You will get 70% of your regular incoming for a maximum of 78 weeks.

So even you may be sick and unable to work for a full year, you will not be without money.

An awesome linux guy is in recovery. It's the community's turn to help him this time.,"Just an anecdote. But a guy at my last job was trying to some fairly normal house maintenance and had an accident. The damage was . . . severe. The company had what is considered a good insurance plan for the US, and he'd even paid for the slightly upgraded one (out of his own paycheck, but it made sense to him since it also covered his wife and two children). Like has been said, that does not cover short or long term disability. Fortunately our employer did provide some short term and IIRC some long term, but as has been said no federal mandate. But it really wasn't that long if you have a broken wrist, ankle, and spine. It wasn't going to cover his recovery time. Note that on top of that his wife was the only actual income earner with him out of work. He was quite depressed thinking about it. It did work out for him (other than he'll never have the full range of motion and was stressed out), but I've already given too many unique details.

Just one more point, workers off work for injury (probably pregnancy, too but I haven't seen it happen) have no protections from non-specific firings. Layoffs, eliminating a redundant group, etc. Not a problem for the man that's the subject of this thread, but workers employed by a company have that hanging over their heads as well. And if you're no longer employed, you eventually lose the employer provided insurance or have to pay the full price (whatever was already puled from your paycheck plus whatever part your employer paid, at that point it is called COBRA insurance which might stand for something but I think was named as a warning that it's venomous and will financially kill you).

Taste is subjective and it's not common that a reviewer can say anything particularly positive about input devices, so coverage is deliberately limited. The typical consumer doesn't have nearly as wide of a range of experience with different keyboards/trackpads as a reviewer or computing professional, so frankly most of them don't know what they would be missing.

People don't like negativity in general, and there are commercial and advertising reasons why reviews are very rarely going to lambaste a product. The readers are going to tend to shop the ""speeds and feeds"" (spec numbers) anyway, so the reviewers are going to try to give them what they want. The reader wants to know things like ""is there any particular reason I shouldn't buy this attractive-seeming model with the attractive specs and the attractive price?""

Trackpads are the biggest reason why I prefer not to use laptops, but you just can't talk most people into desktops these days. They're just not willing to accept a mobility and size constriction for an advantage that's only theoretical to them. So they keep buying the laptops and attach displays, docks, keyboards, and all so ubiquitously, external mice.

Microsoft's ""Precision Touchpad"" hardware spec is trying to match Macs, now, though, and it seems like a good idea and very promising. Explicit coverage of it in the Linux world is nearly nonexistent, though. I believe a driver has been mainlined, but nobody every talks about it, so I don't know.

Looks like they go through audits which is good... but Five Eyes does too, and they pass all of those just as easily... I'd say trusting either Chinese or Five Eyes backed products will inevitably  lead to spyware one way or the other. It's just deciding if you want it to be Chinese or Five Eyes spyware.

Clevo does not sell laptops to consumers. They sell chassis to vendors like System76. We only sell hardware that's supported on Linux, so if you are to buy a Clevo unit from another OEM, there's no guarantee that it's going to work well on Linux. You might end up with a NIC without a supported Ethernet/WiFi driver, for example. You certainly won't have the option to use open source firmware unless you use our open source firmware as a base (work in progress).

S76 has to charge enough to make a profit on the money spent, same as any company must do if it wants to continue to exist. That margin really isn't that high, though. You're also paying for open source software development, open source firmware engineering, open source IC designs, and free lifetime support (No ""Apple Care""-like contract required).

So ... it was because it came preinstalled?

I should note that the ""no googling, no issues with setup"" as well as being very sturdy and well-built is *exactly why* people love the ThinkPads.   The difference is that you can get a great Linux experience with a very solid ThinkPad (with a good screen) off of ebay for around $200.

Of course, everyone does. But System76 shuts off the Intel IME, and provides a custom-tailored OS, with guaranteed-to-work hardware. I'd say that's worth a premium, especially now as there's little competition in the Linux box market.

Second, while low-level support for touchpad hardware is of course crucial, what Apple gets right is that it essentially forces devs to conform to conventions and support all fancy features. Even Windows is nowhere near as consistent. Exhibit A: smooth scrolling, which some apps support, but many don't.  Linux is even more spotty.

Actually, let me throw in a third comment: an issue in the non-Mac world is that trackpad hardware is very diverse. However, Microsoft is (finally!) pushing their ""precision touchpad"" specification.

Linux touchpad like a Macbook: progress and a call for help,"Consider 4-finger left or right gesture for desktop switching. You put 4 fingers down on the touchpad, and start moving. What happens is that the desktop switcher actually triggers before your eyes while your fingers are still down on the touchpad. If you pause the movement, the desktop switching also stops. If I move fingers back, the gesture reverses and puts the old desktop back. It's not ""gesture"" at all in sense that it's something you complete and then it triggers and does something; the key thing is that on Apple, gestures are integrated into whatever window manager it has, and they all respond in real time while you're doing them, and interrupting your motion pauses the gesture.

It is fluid, continuous control, very intuitive, and basically the same smooth movement that you get with moving the pointer with a single finger, except using more fingers brings in ever grander concepts of ""moving"" something, until you have four and are moving entire desktops, just like you'd move a mouse pointer. On GNOME, I have a poor copy of this in that I do 4 finger swipe and then it triggers a switch. I can live with it, but on a macOS device I'd already be staring at the other desktop, while GNOME only just realized that I want to switch and starts animating the transition.

Inertia with scrolling is also available in every application. Neither Firefox nor Chrome can do it on Linux. This is a big one, it's really annoying to scroll without inertia these days in the arguably two most important applications of the whole Linux desktop. I guess I'll try the GNOME browser on the new 19.04 Ubuntu just to see if it wouldn't suck as much to use as Firefox and Chrome do right now.

There also used to be an issue with pixel perfect scrolling where you can scroll up, down or sideways by 1 px increments just by making a small 2-finger scroll motion. We got this now thanks to new Qt and GTK+3, so this is no longer really a point in favor of Apple. On Linux, scrolling used the be chunky, as in, you do the gesture and initially nothing moves until it has measured long enough motion, then it does a single mouse wheel click, and then application responds to that simulated event by moving up some 50 px at once. You could not scroll less than one mouse wheel click by using the touchpad gesture. This got fixed fairly recently, I remember looking into it a few years back and having to pass some random environment variables to make it kinda-sorta work.

Some personal history: I used to use Linux, and had mice in my laptop carry back because touchpads on neither windows nor Linux cut it. They were all so small and annoying to use, and the joystick nipple in middle of keyboard never really felt that nice to me, so mouse it was. Until I got my first Apple computer sometime in 2012 or so, and I soon realized I don't use the mouse anymore. Compared to the touchpad, it's just a cumbersome, slow and inaccurate device, needing to be dug out of the bag, connected, have a flat surface to operate on, and I don't think I could even use it as fast or as accurately as with the touchpad.

In my mental model of what it meant to be a mobile worker, I crossed over the one thing I always had to carry with me and plug in before I could get to work. I think it wasn't even the gestures, inertia scrolling or crap like that which made me love the touchpad. It was basically that the thing was physically big enough to allow reaching the other edge of the desktop with a single motion, and it didn't go overboard with acceleration so it was precise. It also helps that Apple has always had absolutely faultless palm/thumb detection so it literally never does an accidental click or pointer movement unless I actually have a finger tip on it and want to use it. It might just as well read my mind, it works that well. On my Linux laptop, an otherwise nice ASUS ZenBook, I have learnt to type with my thumbs in the air because the damn touchpad always registers random clicks and pointer motion if I don't.",9,linux,audioen,

Personally I've found linux touchpads to be pretty unpleasant to use, as someone who's spent a number of years on macbooks. I end up only really using a mouse on linux, which is a bit limiting. It has been a while since I used a Linux touchpad daily over a longer period of time though, so I can't speak for how they've improved lately.

It would be nice to know to what extent these feelings are personal vs objective. But it's hard to quantify.. There is http://mouseaccuracy.com which gets some of the way at least in measuring accuracy.. But if the trackpads works well but are poorly integrated into applications, it wouldn't measure that.

As a small test I ran mouseaccuracy.com a few times on a macbook, with settings 'Hard'/'Small'/30 seconds as the author of the article did and got similar results.. ~300 points, ~99% accuracy on the macbook, score dropped by half on my linux laptop where I only use the touchpad occasionally.

I'd be interested in seeing how someone who uses a linux touchpad frequently fares on the test, if any of you have a few minutes to spare! :)

"[release] brig 0.4.0: distributed, versioned & secure file synchronization","The short summary goes probably something like this:

Advantages:

* Better versioning, similar to git but a little simplified.
* Having IPFS as a base, you don't need to have the data actually on your computer, you can simply choose what you want to store by pinning it.
* Truly distributed in the sense that we don't require a discovery server to find other devices.

Disadvantages:

&#x200B;

* Syncthing is way more mature and battle-proofed.
* Easy to understand, use and setup.
* It's probably also faster (just an assumption, I don't have benchmarks)

Potentially. [In 2012, Valve got more performance out of OpenGL on Linux than proprietary API on Windows, even after heavily tuning both.](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/)

Vulkan games on Linux, ported by Feral Interactive, have been faster than Windows -- but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison for several reasons.

Linux is definitely faster in I/O, but that doesn't lead directly to better game performance. Faster level loading, perhaps. At any rate, /r/Linux_Gaming is where you'll find a lot of information on this.

It is literally all about the different ways of shipping the software to the user.

(Intel's Clear Linux is a bit special though, because of special compiling optimizations, which in theory anyone could do on other distributions, but then you would need to compile the packages yourself, duh. On the other side if you use Clear Linux you are forced to use Flatpaks for a lot of applications, which should be less optimized in theory)
  
The main reason why many games run less performant on Linux is usually because they were written with DirectX in mind, instead of Vulkan from scratch.

Outside of native games, if you're willing to enable SteamPlay for all games on Steam, and check protondb before running a game, and potentially do some absolutely minimal tweaks to get a game to work then the number of games you can run on Linux is huge.

For example with a launch parameter tweak, I can play GTA Online on Mint, with a controller. That's my favourite game so I'm really happy that just works so easily. It runs almost flawlessly and at about 80% of the fps I was getting under Windows. I also play Elder Scrolls Online too, it runs without any tweaks, but sometimes the launcher freezes while opening. Close it and reopen and it works. Very minor problem and no issues in game, similar story with the performance too.

Definitely check out ProtonDB and see how many of your top 20 games are playable and to what degree.

I would say gaming on Linux is now good enough to dual boot and spend 95% of your time on Linux, unless a game you love is borked. Windows is still required for a few popular games. If a game doesn't run at all on Linux right now, overwhelmingly the reason is usually due to anticheat built into a game (common for many popular pvp online games) hence PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex, Fortnite, are all unplayable for now. But if you don't play those games then that isn't an issue.

It sandwiches beetween linux and the game in question and somwhat translates the DirectXCalls most games use to Vulkan-calls which linux can understand. But with that we introduce a performance penalty on said game. 

To better this scenario a distro wouldn't really make a ton of difference really. (Thats my guess) 

Other things might help more to get linux gaming ready for primetime. 

1. more good linux ports of games or more vulkan based games in general -> Problem here linux-market is miniscule compared to windows, so why support it? 


2. reduce the overhead of wine/proton to minimum and make them more compatable. -> dxvk and other tools make a great job of doing this. Once this is done it could lead to a bigger market share for linux. Thats when 1 would become an option. Also supporting wine/proton isn't that hard for a dev.

Problem, is, it isn't true.  Software is packaged differently for different distros (where they use different package managers), that much is true.  Once it's installed there's very little difference , especially where you're installing closed-source binaries which are compiled by the developer.

Windows developers aren't always comfortable with the idea of a community maintainer packaging their software (which can be done even with closed-source binaries), so they want to do it all themselves, which requires knowledge of the package formats.

There is also the issue that we don't just randomly download software from website to install it.

&#x200B;

To make an example your teacher should understand well if they've been using computers for a while: id Software took DooM and Quake 1/2/3 open-source. Those games are not free software. All they distributed was the code; they did not distribute the levels, the artwork, the music and cinematics and so on (in Quake games, they're usually stored in a file called pak1.pak, which isn't included with the source). The code allowed for projects like Yamagi Quake II and Tenebrae, modern builds bringing the game engine into alignment with modern OSes instead of running an ancient executable that looks for 20 year old components. But while you could modify and compile new builds of the code you weren't legally allowed to download all the assets of the full game, compile it yourself, and share more free copies to your friends. That's still piracy.

That's probably the most elementary example I can think of regarding the differences between open source and free software.

School Project About Richard Stallman and The Open Source Movement,"> none of us really knows anything about Linux..

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",1,linux,skocznymroczny,

https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html

You can also read the mindset in the 90s. When Microsoft had just gained control of 90% of the PC market and commercial unix systems dominated every mainframe in the world. You had to use activex, flash, and java applets to do work and their was a real fear that systems would be locked down with government mandated and standardized DRM.

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html

It sorta happened.... cablecard for example... we need a key from microsoft to boot many uefi bioses, but people are dropping cable and Linux has grown enough most vendors wouldn't dare lock Linux out. Governments have mandated certain proprietary apps. South Korea for example took forever to move off an activex applet.

Now a days, system usage is divided with the iOS, Android, Chromebooks and Windows. Linux is nothing in the desktop world, but it is everything in the server world. Android and ChromeOS are semi-free... with Google and hardware vendors contributing to many parts. In some ways, free software has really grown and dominates parts of the industry and in others it barely exists.",1,linux,perfectdreaming,

If you do want to focus on RMS and Free Software  I highly recommend reading Free as in Freedom.  It's an AMAZING biography about RMS (Richard M Stallman) from 2002.  Another great resource is watching Revolution OS which is focused on Linux, but it does dip into the world of Free Software with some great quotes from RMS and Torvalds which tend to have a similar dynamic to Job and Gates.

[accessibility] want to help the least of us?,"Hiya, I'm the maintainer of [sway](https://swaywm.org). I'm interested in working on a11y for Wayland. Recently I started working on FOSS full-time, so I hope to be able to spend a decent chunk of time on improvements in this respect. I think Sway stands a good chance of being inherently more accessible for the blind/visually impaired than desktops like GNOME, because the mental map of a tiling window manager is more easily reasoned about than the mental map of a stacking window manager like GNOME or KDE. Sway is also designed to be manipulated with the keyboard and is very powerful in this respect.

I'm sighted, but one of my goals is to be productive at least 1-2 days a week with all of my monitors turned off. I've started on a few projects towards this end:

- [vim speak](https://github.com/ddevault/vimspeak)
- [sway talk](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/dotfiles/tree/master/bin/swaytalk)
- [this weechat plugin](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/dotfiles/tree/master/.weechat/python/talkative.py)

There are other a11y tools for other kinds of users I want to work on, like a nice magnifying glass tool (which should work better on Wayland than it does on X due to better hidpi support - I can double the DPI of the magnified region), high contrast and colorblind modes, mouse stabilization, and so on. I'd also like to make a nice accessible email client. If anyone has more ideas, I'd love to hear them.

With respect to Orca, I'd like to get better support for it on sway & wlroots, but I don't like its design and I'm a little bit headstrong, so I'm hoping that doing things like turning off my displays for days at a time will give me enough empathy to find novel new solutions even if they're not what you're used to.

I've tried many, many times to make that work for me, but it honestly just makes using my computer feel like pulling teeth. I don't mean to come off as if I'm just complaining for the sake of complaining so I won't list a whole bunch of examples, but for me personally, it just feels way too rough and buggy. By that I mean the entire accessibility stack, a lot of which is very old and hacky, but especially Orca in terminal windows and on the web (yes, there are console screen readers, but using them in conjunction with Xorg is cumbersome at best).

There are lots of applications that are just not written with accessibility in mind, which is the case on all platforms, but I'd say more so on Linux. I'm sorry I come off as so negative and I really am grateful for what we have, and part of me thinks I shouldn't even be complaining since Linux isn't my desktop platform, but having this topic come up at all is rare, so I figured I might as well.

Another big issue for me is TTS on Linux. The ""best"" (as in easiest to set up) option is ESpeak, which I just cannot listen to for long periods of time. That's a very unpopular opinion in blind Linux groups, and you'll often get shit on for stating it, but I mean, it's not trivial to ""just make your own"" synthesizer if you don't like it. [Here are some examples, if you're curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziGpZTKZko).

There also seems to be a tendency to want to create separate Linux distributions that are accessible out of the box, usually meaning that they come up speaking when booted from a live environment. We don't need (yet another) Linux distro that does that; there are plenty of them already, and often there is a keyboard shortcut to activate the screen reader on mainstream ones, which someone inclined to try Linux for the first time would probably be able to figure out if they got as far as booting it. Again, I apologize for coming off as so negative. I really do love Linux. I have a few Linux servers and I'd say it's the OS I have the most knowledge of, internally.

there is no way, as a developer, that i can work independently of the windowing system developers to develop new and interesting ways to communicate through the user interface, or to link to other applications. one may go through very limited use cases, even if the user explicitly wishes to allow wider (less ""secure"") use.

Why doesn't academia embrace Linux more?,"Most of the answers here are good ones, but I'll add a little bit more.

First: industry standards.  A university that doesn't prepare its graduates to use whatever their field uses is not doing its job.  So if a given industry is *nix-focused, that's what they should work on.  If it's Windows-based, then it would be irresponsible not to teach people how to use whatever software they'll actually be using once they graduate.

When I was in law school, Word was *the* standard.  It's what everyone in school had used.  An example: for one of my classes, we had to send our final paper to everyone in the class prior to presenting it one day.  One of my classmates could not understand why I'd sent everyone a PDF rather than a Word doc.  Obviously he understood when I mentioned having a Mac (the real reason was that I'd used LaTeX to write the thing since (1) fuck paying for MS Word, and (2) it let me swap between my Macbook and the help desk's desktop which was Windows-based).  But the fact that this was strange enough to be remarked upon should tell you something.  And this was back when most everything was submitted in hard copy (such as exams), so in many respects it was *easier* than it is now.

Once I got out, Word was what everyone in the legal profession used.  I was involved in a case with one guy who sent me a WordPerfect file, but that was absolutely the exception.  Cross-compatibility is everything when you're having to send written documents to other people in other organizations.  And you really do not want to risk something getting broken in the conversion, because in the law even [one comma](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/business/worldbusiness/25comma.html) can matter.  My current job uses some template-building scripts, but they're all written in VBA for MS Word.  I flat-out *can't* use something else.  I could easily do the same scripting and do it all in Markdown or whatever, but then it has to go to someone else who has to be able to do some editing, and then off to some other part of the Bureaucracy.  Best-case something (say, an academic journal) is platform-agnostic, but at that point you're still going to use what you're most familiar with.

The other thing is that academia is more than just CompSci.  I was a liberal arts undergrad (history, specifically) prior to law school.  The level of computer literacy that I encountered through that time was, with rare exceptions, on a spectrum between ""can play Counterstrike with me"" to ""grandparent"" (I worked tech support at both places, and this was not limited to liberal arts people).  If you're going to support it, you have to deal with some 60-year-old English professor trying to understand how Linux works.  You also have to consider the amount of extra time you're wasting: if you have some prolific researcher or writer, how much of their time do you want to use up in forcing them (if you can) to learn a new workflow?

And let me tell you: supporting tenured faculty *sucks*.  They've done the same things for 30 years, and aren't about to change now, and no one can make them.  One example:  I was working the law school help desk during the summer that the school switched from XP to Vista.  (We all hated Vista, but it wasn't up to us.  Plus, I cared less since I used a Mac.)   I had a law school professor who was a prolific writer (and whom I actually liked a great deal).  He did all of his writing on WordPerfect 6.  As in, the DOS version of WordPerfect.  Our job was not to convince him to change to something more modern (and to be fair, if he had a good workflow in WP 6, our time was much less valuable than his), but instead to figure out how to get WordPerfect to run under Windows Vista with its neutered compatibility layer.  I don't remember how, but we did get it to work (and it wasn't that hard).  But we did have to spend some time showing him how the new layout of Explorer worked.  How much time would it have taken us to teach him about ``sudo``?

I understand where you're coming from, and in many ways would love to see Linux get more use in academia.  But as is always the case, it's a chicken-and-the-egg problem.  If people won't be using Linux after they get out of school, it doesn't make much sense to train them on it in school.  Anyone posting in this sub, I expect, *groks* computers and how they work.  So it's easy to forget how incomprehensible they are for many, even among younger people.

With all of this, I'm not at all surprised, even if I do wish things would change.

That way the version of Manjaro that you use is the latest version, provided that you update it.

Both operating systems come with a lot of softwares in their repositories(Manjaro with AUR and LM with Ubuntu PPAs make the list larger) and good documentation and forums thanks to the distributions they are based on.(although Arch Wiki takes the cake on that one)

I would say that if you are a user who used Windows 10 for basic stuff, Mint is better because  it helps the new user and DEs like Cinnamon and MATE look a lot like Windows. Otherwise, Manjaro is the way to go.

Most of it's DE's (editions as you said) are visually closer to Windows style thus the process of going over should be easier.

Mint from my experience will recognize your hardware easier and you probably won't have to install drivers for various hardware.

Mint is built on Ubuntu which means if you have a problem and search online for a solution if the solution mentions Ubuntu as most search results do, 99% of the time it will work for Mint as well, plus if a software has a Linux version this most of the time means an Ubuntu version but again this will work for Mint the same.

Mint's compatibility with Ubuntu is an advantage that cannot be understated.

Now which version of Mint is right for you ?

Search for screen shot of the various Mint versions Cinnamon, Mate, Xfce etc and see which one you like the most visually.

Cinnamon probably will look the best to you, but it also the one that demands the most resources Mate will be second place probably but will demand less resources etc.

My setup is a little different (not using USB), but I'd think this could be adjusted to fit what you have.

1.  Generate a keyfile for the ``/boot`` partition, which on my setup is a separate partition from what's mounted at ``/boot/efi``. (I just used ``dd`` to give me some random data), and save it in the root partition (mine is in ``/etc/``)).  

1.  ``cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdx [key file]``

      ``[entry in /dev/mapper]     /dev/sdx    [location of key]   luks``

(``/dev/sdx``, of course, refers to the partition that's mounted at ``/boot``).

4.  ``cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdy [keyfile]`` (where ``/dev/sdy`` is the partition containing the LVM setup)

4.  Add this keyfile to the ``FILES=`` entry in ``/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`` (and regenerate it, obviously).

"Creating a hardened Arch Linux installation with linux-hardened, Full Disk Encryption(with detached LUKS2 header), encrypted /boot on a USB, AppArmor, firejail, TCP/IP hardening","Author of this section here:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Encrypted_.2Fboot_and_a_detached_LUKS_header_on_USB

I thought I would provide my perspective in case any of the ideas help you, even though your method is different.

That wiki section is part of a larger guide I wrote here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/7np36m/detached_luks_header_full_disk_encryption_with/

First and foremost, it's important to keep in mind a crucial part of the idea was to use UEFI secure boot with your *own* keys. That way you can do your best to keep the key secret and someone wouldn't be able to somehow sign a different bootloader and kernel. I briefly mentioned secure boot in the ""Boot Loader"" section:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Boot_Loader

I see many people here wondering what the ""point"" is of all this, of having an encrypted boot key usb. Well the point makes more sense when you use UEFI secure boot. I used [sbupdate](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sbupdate-git/) to bundle the bootloader, kernel, and initramfs all into one .efi image then signed it with my own keys generated through [cryptboot](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cryptboot/). So the .efi file is on the unencrypted EFI system partition, and the /boot partition and main drive have already been encrypted during the installation process.

The initramfs has a custom encrypt hook script, which checks for the UUID of the usb drive before doing anything, then decrypts an encrypted keyfile, which at a particular offset and size is then used to decrypt the main hard drive. So at boot I would enter two passwords, one for the encrypted /boot partition and one for the encrypted keyfile.

The crux of all this is the `header.img`, it's not embedded in the initramfs but instead read live from the boot partition. So if I was say, traveling somewhere privacy-invasive I could remove the `header.img` (keeping an encrypted copy somewhere online or offline that is accessible) and then if I was forced to attempt decrypting and booting, the hard drive and keyfile are useless without the LUKS header (which is why you should have an encrypted backup somewhere, as well as the keyfile). And if I ""lost"" the boot key, the main hard drive is just random data with no header so it provides some plausible deniability, if that's worth anything.

The /boot partition contains secret or sensitive information because of the secure boot keys, `header.img`, and the encrypted keyfile. Part of my concern was passive copying attacks where somehow malware or an adversary gets copies of the files I use for booting. Since I can't always leave the usb unplugged because of system updates, the encrypted keyfile is the main secret. In hindsight, I should have found a way to encrypt the header.img and have it decrypted by the custom encrypt hook in the initramfs.

In conclusion, the encrypted usb key with secure boot offers some advantages:

* You have to have something and know something to start the system. There's no kernel, bootloader, LUKS header, or keys on the main hard drive.  If someone did have the boot key, you have to know the passphrase to open the /boot partition, and another for the keyfile.

* Secure boot only accepts the signed .efi. As long as you keep the custom key and certificate secret, this isn't something that can be easily replicated and used to boot, which prevents booting without the exact boot key or having your secure boot keys.

* The keyfile is encrypted so even if they had your secure boot keys and copied everything else to replicate your boot key, they might not know the passphrase to decrypt the keyfile which in turn decrypts the hard drive. I didn't like the idea in the other examples of the keyfile and header being embedded into the initramfs because it makes the initramfs too powerful if someone else copies it while your /boot partition is decrypted.

Things that I would improve if I did it again in the future would be to:

* Change the custom encrypt hook to `cryptsetup close` the /boot partition, so it's not decrypted when you boot into the system.

* Encrypt `header.img` similarly to the keyfile, decrypting it with the custom encrypt hook in the initramfs.

* Keep my secure boot keys in an encrypted container on the usb. Then when I update the system, I would simply wait until later to copy the new files to my /boot partition. And also rebuild the initramfs and run sbupdate later, preferably from the install cd by chrooting into the system. It's a little extreme but I wouldn't want to have the secure boot keys decrypted on the regular system as they are crucial to securing the boot process.

Last point I will make are mitigations (you would want to do these offline in a safe environment, like a verified install cd) if secret or sensitive material is stolen:

* If they have your passphrase or keyfile, you can change it with `cryptsetup luksChangeKey`

* If they have your header and a passphrase or keyfile, you would have to rencrypt your drives with `cryptsetup-reencrypt` to change the master key. If you simply change the passphrase or keyfile, they can restore the old header and use the compromised key, because the master key is the same.

* If they have your secure boot keys you would have to regenerate them, then create and sign a new .efi file to boot with.

I know it's a long post that's not 100% relevant to what you want to do, but I'd hate to stay silent since I did see this on my feed and thought maybe some explanation would help you develop your idea further.

edit: I forgot to mention you really need a power-on and admin password set for your computer's UEFI settings, which still gets called the ""BIOS"" menu. That way secure boot can't be circumvented.

Given that Linux runs so many popular easy to use scripting languages out of the box there will likely be a slight rise of script kitties playing around with scripts to gain access and screw around on systems.

We said the same thing about Apple about 10-15 years ago as far as virus' due to Mac OS' low user count, we cannot say the same today. As there is a large number of users and a large number of them are computer illiterate, so they are a low hanging fruit. And hackers (especially script kitties) go after the low hanging fruit. 

OP also mentions AppArmor and a similar module SELinux that help limit application's usage. So if you dont want a program to randomly open up an unsecure port, you can block it from doing so. ~~This is essentially the closest Linux has to true AV right now~~. you can use SELinux (probably can too with AppArmor) to flag weird (attempted) app activity and have it give you alerts. That way you can investigate what it is actually doing. 


edit: AV statement wasnt really true. ClamAV would be a 'true' (traditional) AV solution. SELinux would be a 'harder' solution.",1,linux,the_lost_carrot,

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Encrypted_.2Fboot_and_a_detached_LUKS_header_on_USB

It is the second example of a detached LUKS header, not the first one. I didn't notice my mistake until now.

In the example on the wiki `loop` is loaded as a module in the initramfs, so when you `cryptsetup open` the keyfile it actually creates a loop device because it is not a partition. It is similar to an encrypted container you would make with veracrypt or truecrypt.

In the custom encrypt hook you can see I just use `/dev/mapper/lukskey` directly, but if I wanted to I could create a filesystem and mount it after it has been decrypted with `cryptsetup open`

So for the `header.img` I would use the same method, either directly or with a filesystem.

This is not meant as any sort of offense towards yourself. The issue I have is that your post, although it's not without useful information, is that it's another HowTo.  I just find HowTos, especially those provided by the average person tinkering to be extremely lacking. In this case, you've admitted you've never heard of CIS, USGCB, etc and written a *hardening* guide.

This is especially concerning when Average Joe is going to probably end up copying you and believing they've followed some sort of best practice or something, which is unfortunate for Average Joe since there's no way to measure how effective your secured system is without testing against it with some security penetration tools or at least measuring compliance against established security best practice/benchmarks.

One interesting thing you have done that isn't currently benchmarked by any credible organization (as far as I know at this time, although I'm not exactly up to date since I haven't had to do any sec stuff for a while) is a firejail set up. It's neat to see it in action, but, once again, we go back to the fact that it's a HowTo and there's a complete lack of information about the effectiveness of it in the wild so I'm skeptical about the actual benefits of configuring it (Although I could absolutely be wrong because I honestly don't know much about firejail at all)

So, the comment isn't *""what a shit post this guy did""*, it's more of, here's another HowTo with some correct and incorrect information from somebody who will impress the masses and possibly cause Average Joe to configure is server poorly. It's not that your post is purely negative and without some good/known proven hardening, but we're on Reddit and all the script kiddies are going to get excited about your hardened Arch when they should, instead of looking at the Arch wiki for random tips, be researching and applying/verify configurations using best practices from established organizations/entities.",5,linux,LinuxLeafFan,

Compiz-Reloaded,"I have a lot of respect for mgraesslin, though I feel the need to correct the record on the post that was linked to here:

> And then something happened which is in my opinion the reason why Compiz  vanished: Unity adopted Compiz as their window manager. Canonical  started to fund the development, to hire the main developer. So why was  that in any way bad? it destroyed the community. Compiz became an  in-house project of Canonical. Development moved from git to in-house  launchpad and bazaar, a fork ""Compiz++"" was created, the mailing list  died. I was (and think still am) subscribed to their mailing list and it  just went down in threads. The development must have moved elsewhere  without mentioning it on the mailing list.

This isn't entirely true. The ""compiz++"" C++ rewrite was started in [2008](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Njk1Ng), long before Unity V1 even existed. The developers at the time adopted it as the main line of development a month or two later as the 0.9 series of development.

Its worth understanding why compiz++ came into existence. The 0.8 C-based version of compiz was great, but it was proving difficult to maintain. With hindsight, perhaps a large part of this was [CADT](https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html), but I think it had some merit as well. The C code in Compiz isn't like the C code in GNOME or other big C projects. There were no patterns for memory management, not too many patterns for passing abstract types around and the code was tricky to extend, relying on all sorts of undocumented conventions to get everything to play together. There was some work going on at the time to add some GObject-like patterns to Compiz but it never really came to fruition.

This was fine for a little while but this state of affairs was definitely a sense of frustration among the maintainers, so some of them started working on compiz++ under wraps. I think its worth noting at this point that the maintainers who had basically been doing all the work were unpaid volunteers and burnout was probably starting to kick in.

Like all rewrites, compiz++ was one of those very ambitious things that looked good on paper but turned out to have emergent complexity in practice. compiz++ tried to fix way too many pet-peeves that developers had in the core window manager at once. This is fine when you just restrict your view of the world to the core, but when you're also responsible for maintaining 50+ different thousand-line long plugins, the burden of that workload can get pretty heavy. Consider that for every plugin, the maintainers not only had to adapt it to the new C++ interface in the core, but also adapt it to handle multiple rendering backends, handle the case that logical textures could be split across several hardware textures, handle the new way of doing plugin ordering, etc etc etc.

Here's where I entered the picture. I had a couple of years of programming experience under my belt so I volunteered to help port over some of those plugins. I can't say that I was particularly *good* at it, but I knew enough to kind of figure it out. The existing maintainers all sort of burned out and to be honest I don't blame them for it. The hype cycle had kind of come and gone, the forums were mostly a ghost town and nobody wanted to moderate them, the regulars from IRC were more or less gone and myself and a few other people basically became the last people maintaining it.

It was basically a dead project by mid-2010 already. Someone from Canonical approached me about using it for the version of Unity that most people are now familiar with because they were having trouble getting Clutter to do what they wanted. I started working at Canonical and the team there made the integration between the shell and the window manager a reality. The rest is history, really

I don't think its fair to say that Canonical killed the community around the project. The reality was that there was no community around the project by that time. I agreed to move the project to Launchpad because we wanted to integrate compiz development with the rest of the development practices at Ubuntu - eg, pre-commit code review, continuous integration, etc. At no point was anybody locked out - in fact people still submit patches upstream to compiz on launchpad today.

I think its unfortunate that I wasn't able to mobilize the community to get on board with the 0.9 series. I take that as a personal failing. It had the unfortunate stigma of being of lesser quality than the 0.8 series and probably rightly so - when you rewrite that much code things are bound to break and users don't really care all that much about how it works under the hood. That stigma was probably made worse by ""unity-isolationism"" - Unity was this very Ubuntu-specific thing and thus anything associated with it got that label as well. Like all things, that has now come and gone.

I held this view all the way back in 2013 and I still hold it today. I think that trying to continue the compiz project is laudable but unless a sustainable community can be built around it, its going to be a dead end. Its worth pointing out that compiz 0.8 uses a rendering model that has been deprecated in OpenGL for years and doesn't work at all on mobile hardware. It is also not a wayland compositor and has Xlib dependencies all over the place. The 0.8 branch at least has no tests and very little in the way of documentation. Its unfortunate that this is the case, but time has marched forward. C'est la vie.",18,linux,smspillaz,

I personally think compiz/emerald has nicer looking (and more) desktop effects and nicer looking window decoration themes. kwin does have some of the most important desktop effects (like wobbly windows), but no burn or dream effects, and no pointless drawing fire on the screen or fish tank cube or whatnot. Also, surprisingly no window shading animations, which is a little surprising, but I suppose just no one has made one yet.

Kwin seems more practical though, all things considered. I tend to switch back and forth as my mood takes me. lol.

I was a in a similar situation last week. After upgrading my dedicated server, my server started to behave really strangely. It would freeze pretty hard and then I had to do hard reboot to recover.

The thing is I don't often reboot it and probably never noticed the cronjob until I rebooted the server.

So somehow someone got access to my server, installed his own public key in .ssh/authorized_keys and installed a cronjob that would boot proxy servers. I look at the file it was starting and inside the script it starts multiple times the same damn proxy server.

I changed password removed the cronjob and since then no more problems but it sounds to sloppy of a job.

I have been hacked through a cronjob (mining malware probably),"Commenting more to watch this thread. Very interesting stuff.

I guess in your position, I'd be interested in all the system logs, but I guess any good attack will try to cover tracks there. See anything else around the timeframe of when the cron table was modified?

Was the system proper rooted? Which cron table was edited? What was the user/process running the miner?

I always wondered if it was possible/viable to constantly submit garbage shares in response to being stuck in an attacker's mining pool, too. Might make for an interesting automatic countermeasure whenever these things were detected. Probably it isn't intensive, anyhow. Plugging the security hole is probably also just... a bigger priority, heh.

Edit: Will probably say it's not likely you were hacked through a cronjob, specifically, but at least the cronjob would be them making a home of your system there and keeping the payload intact/up-to-date. Something happened as a precursor. Maybe through the exposed webserver. Is it running privileged enough for the user to achieve what they did?

I have been hacked through a cronjob (mining malware probably),"At a glance, the mostly likely scenario is they attacked you via the open SSH port. Especially since you used the default port 22 for it. Its also possible any of the other open ports and software using them was vulnerable.

Not sure what Distro your on, but if you have SEL disabled that could be an issue too, especially if you have port 80 open for an http server. SEL could block http from writes (unless you need write).

Not an iptables wizard, but your rules to allow everything seem like a bad idea (even if its temporary). You should also consider setting rules by service and not by port, especially on non-standard ports. IE allowing http instead of port 80 so that other services cant cross port 80.

If you are using an http server, you should consider forcing SSL (TLS 1.2+ only) and getting a free SSL cert (or at least a self signed one). Mozilla has a great tool to help securly configure SSL here [https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/)

You may also consider using a VPN to connect from outside your network instead of opening SSH up. Same for other stuff on your server, if connecting to it via VPN is feasible.

You should at least disable root from SSH and change the port if you keep it enabled for outside access.

I would also recommend checking your router and router firmware to make sure it wasnt compromised as well. If your router has logs, check them. If it has recent firmware updates then update it. If its last update is more than a year old I would consider a new router thats kept up to date still by the company. Alternatively, if your current router is compatible with open-source router firmware like dd-wrt you may consider switching it.",-6,linux,Zer0CoolXI,

I have been hacked through a cronjob (mining malware probably),"Just a tip -- anything that is serving up an http server, go ahead and encrypt it.

Free TLS/SSL certs:

[https://letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org)

If the service natively does not support https, use a reverse proxy to encrypt the service.  Limit the service to localhost and only expose the encrypted endpoint to the wider net.

[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/)

Now that you've encrypted your traffic, configure a username and password to access said services if the service supports it.  Also -- make sure to serve the service on a non-default port when exposing it to the wider web to prevent bots from scanning and picking up your server.

Edit..

To add as other's have suggested, move ssh to a different port and make sure nothing is running on port 80, 8080.  If serving up on port 443, drop all requests without a subdomain landing.

Seriously, just stop doing this. This is the dumbest advice anyone can ever offer, particularly if you move it above 1023. Most scanners look for 2200 and 2222 now, and it's just an arms race that cuts down on your log noise, which is very manageable with other means. You've then traded configuration of literally every software that interacts with SSH for dealing with log noise, and good luck if you can't shove a `-p` down. ""Move SSH to another port"" is cargo cult dogma, plain and simple, **with absolutely no security benefit.** That it's presented as secure lulls people into dormancy, and that people I respect write blog posts to defend it (while also advocating fail2ban; hello DoS vector!) is frustrating.

If you move SSH to 2200, you've now given *normal users* the ability to pretend to be `sshd` on your machine. Think through the implications of that. The user you're ""couple of things""ing also wasn't compromised via SSH, so it's even more pointless advice.

Things that I would normally have had to dig through config files or settings just seem to work.   Wireless works great,  all the keyboard function keys work,  webcam works, connecting an external HDMI works as expected and even managing the audio device to connect through the external HDMI.   

I only have a couple minor complaints so far.  Occasionally when I open the laptop it doesn't recognize that it opened and wake.  I need to close the lid and try again.    

I also got a deal on the laptop for some back to school special.  I suspect they were trying to clear them out because they have Intel Optane memory, essentially a 16GB SSD drive that is used with the bios to make the regular 5400 rpm drive into a hybrid.    This didnt work at all in Linux and I needed to set the Optane to show up as a simple NVME device.   When I installed mint, I put the /usr directory onto the optane drive to try and speed things up a bit.

Also, I just noticed recently that it will run out of battery while suspended and shutdown.  This last one is not really a complaint more that I just need to be careful to either shutdown properly or suspend to disk rather than ram when leaving it for hours unplugged in the bag.

Multi-cloud infrastructure management - help needed,"Good question. Terraform can also do most things that Polynimbus does. However indeed it follows slightly different philosophy, called Infrastructure as Code.

On the other hand, Polynimbus allows more dynamic management of the cloud infrastructure, including using many cloud accounts at once (eg. it was tested in action with over 80 AWS accounts), belonging to different end customers.

Looking less technical, but more functional: Terraform is designed for single big projects (1 project, 1 instance). While Polynimbus was designed from the beginning for IT outsourcing business model. So, despite of similar overall capabilities (Terraform can do much more!), Polynimbus will probably be much cheaper for normal outsourcing operations, since:

- you need to operate just one big cluster instead of separate XX instances with repeatable elements
- its learning curve is much more flat, and you don't need to write custom logic - instead you have 17 very simple shell scripts, with easy-to-process input and output

Also, Polynimbus doesn't try to cover the application level - for example it doesn't have InfluxDB or Postgres drivers, and it only concentrates on cloud IaaS level, while application level can be handled by other part of the stack (eg. Ansible).

This way, in outsourcing company, you can handle IaaS management (which is common for all customers) by Polynimbus, and then handle servers for each customers differently, according to arrangements with particular customer. This would be hard using Terraform - except of 1:1 model, which is possible and obviously expensive to maintain.

I ran the Mid-Willamette Valley Linux User's group in Corvallis, OR for years. It's a lot of hard work. Nearly twenty years later I remember the long days and evenings but I find running the LUG among the most rewarding experiences of my adult life.

It's worth it.

When I tell the stories (and mightily bored the listeners are) I always say, ""if they're going to come out on a Tuesday night I'm going to make sure they have a good time.""

MWVLUG, under my (humble) leadership, we went from seven crumb-shirted geeks to filling up the stadium classroom seating at the (brand-new at the time) Owen Hall at Oregon State University. It was great--we had people coming down from Portland and up from Eugene (1.5 hour drives) to attend.

[deleted] is right--consistency is key. It's like settling into watching your favorite program--you know more-or-less what you're going to get. The content is always fresh but the ""rhythm"" of the ""show"" is more-or-less the same.
Here's what I did:


1.) pre-meeting slide show & music

* set the mood of this meeting's theme


2.) Hellos & Welcomes


3.) ""In The News""

* Hillarious while tactfully ripping on MS,SCO bad <-- not a scandal went unnoticed

> By this time they're whipped up like 1984's ""Two Minutes of Hate""

4.) Introduce Speaker/Deomonstration


5.) Questions/Open Discussion


6.) Beer!

You have to come to the meetings with your ""game face"" on--I mean it. You have to walk in there like you own the place and give your attendees your all...hold nothing back.


I ran [mwvlug.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20030806172755/http://www.mwvlug.org:80/) and almost daily posted new stories there, local and national, with links to the other LUGs and mailing lists.


I remember one of the longest-haired member said after a meeting, ""you know, that takes a lot of guts to put your suit on every week and hold the LUG. Thank you.""


Oh, yeah, and events! PEAK Internet used to loan their booth to us so we could attend events. A lot of times it's free to show if you're a non-profit community group. We'd set up the booth with working Linux computers and I'd line up volunteers to man the booth.


I swear to God I can still remember telling families about Linux while the cows mooed in the background at the Benton County Fair.


So, events, events, events--no venue is too small.


It's a lot of work but one of the most rewarding experiences of your life.

In advance of the meeting:

* Meet monthly on the same day, time, and location if at all possible. If you can't do it personally, delegate the responsibility. 
* Line up speakers at least a couple of months in advance. And gauge your membership for topics. Are you trying to target home users, sysadmins? If you aren't sure who, reach out to current members and maybe local tech businesses to see if they would be interested in presenting (emphasize this is a technical presentation not a sales pitch though.) Emphasize also they don't need to be experts and don't have to know all the answers. If you can't get a prepared speech, consider having a panel discussion with local experts or users and come up with a set of questions to ask.
* Ask local businesses if they would be willing to sponsor meeting space if you can't find any at a more neutral facility like a university.
* If the presenter is not experienced, ask the presenter to defer long answers until the end so that the presentation can wrap on time and people who need to leave, can leave.
* Ideally have a presentation you're personally willing to do or have some back-up panel discussion that can use whoever shows up in case you get a last-minute speaker cancellation (it happens!)
 
At the meeting:

* Allow some slosh ""networking"" time at the beginning for people to show up. Events here often open the doors at 6:30pm, start at 7pm and go up until 8:30pm.
* Have the speaker show up early enough to make any A/V equipment work. Ideally have them email you any slides and have your own computing device available as backup.
* Be willing to step in and ask someone to defer questions until the end if they are basically heckling the speaker. 
* Have an optional dinner outing after, personally I prefer this to dinner at the meeting. We have the LUG members who show up pay for the speakers dinner.
* Allow for announcements at the meeting, like for jobs or other events. If the speaker shows up late you can do this at the beginning, otherwise the end works.

On Steam, you see the icons with the Apple and the Windows? That other one is ""SteamOS"", which is the same thing as Linux.
